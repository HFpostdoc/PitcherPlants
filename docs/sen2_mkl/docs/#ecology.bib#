Six transect plots of 20 x 60 m, 20 x 80 m and 20 x 90 m, with a total area of one hectare were established perpendicular to the coast line. A total of 20 species of trees and saplings, two species of herbs and one species of nypa palm was recorded. Three community types were recognized namely Rhizophora apiculata, Excoecaria agallocha-Rhizophora apiculata and Excoecaria agallocha reflecting the zonation in this forest. The number of trees, saplings and seedlings were 510, 1220 and 11 085 per ha respectively. Rhizophora apiculata was most successful in regeneration with 6231 seedlings per ha (56.2%) and followed by Bruguiera parviflora with 3810 seedlings per ha (34.4%). Seedlings of the first species were mostly growing under gaps while the second species occurred mostly around the mother trees},

Some primers showed diagnostic banding patterns and allowed unambiguous differentiation between B. Sexangula and B. Gymnorhiza without any indication of hybrid individuals. RAPD markers were also used to produce a similarity matrix among individuals of a species. A higher degree of polymorphism was observed within populations of B. Gymnorhiza in Rekawa, situated in the climatically intermediate (between the wet and dry) zone, than within populations from the wet zone (Galle and Negombo). RAPD data analysis did not reveal a clear relationship between genetic differences and macrogeographical variation along the western and southern coastal area in Sri Lanka, but indicated that a small population of B. Sexangula was genetically different. A more pronounced genetic difference at the population level in B. Sexangula than in B. Gynnia marina} and \emph{Sesuvium portulacustrum}},

  Abstract                 = {The fractal properties of specimens of a planar branching sponge Raspailia inaequalis (Porifera, Demospongiae) were determined by analysing digitised photographs. The specimens, collected from a single site in northeastern New Zealand, had a wide range of morphology. Three different fractal methods were used: box counting; a method that gives the scaling of branch length with distance from the base of the fan; and an allometric analysis of the dependence of frontal area on specimen size. All three approaches gave a similar value for the fractal dimension. The conjecture that the specimens have a fractal branching structure is consistent with the results of a Horton analysis of their branching pattern. There is a significant relationship between fractal dimension and number of fingers, which implies that a simple count of the number of fingers is as useful for discriminating between individuals as the more complex fractal analysis. Using this relation, sponges from a site with less water movement are inferred to have a lower fractal dimension. This result is in agreement with the predictions of the Kaandorp model of sponge growth},

All of the white pine, which dominated recruitment during the first 40 years due to more rapid height growth, recruited in this period. Low levels of hemlock recruitment continued until 1900. Most of the younger trees comprised several northern hardwood species. No trees were less than 50 years old and the forest was devoid of an understorey due to intense deer browsing. 3 Radial growth chronologies were determined for 27 cores across all specie,

The various types of mangroves are considered taking into account environmental factors such as the climatic and edaphic parameters, the specific composition of the mangrove- trees, and their development. Then they are compared to the other mangroves of the eastern Pacific and their distinguishing features are described. This work contributes to the knowledge of the macrobenthic faunal and floral communities associated with the mangroves sensu stricto, with the sediment beds of sand and mud on which they grow, and with the biota developing behind the mangrove zone. The regional literature is also drawn upon. An overall scheme is proposed in which to consider zonation and the composition of eastern Pacific mangrove communities. It is hoped that this will serve as a basis for future, more detailed work on these communities, which remain poorly known bionomically},

  Abstract                 = {A simple model of shoot-level carbon gain is presented addressing the optimal number and life span of leaves in relation to alternative optimality criteria: (1) maximizing carbon export from the shoot, or (?) maximizing the rate of leaf production at the shoot tip. Additionally, the processes that cause declining assimilation with leaf age are considered in relation to (1) leaf position on the shoot (e.g., self-shading) versus (2) leaf age per se. Using these alternative scenarios, only a model based on position- dependent assimilation and maximization of leaf production rates resulted in quantitative predictions for all aspects of leaf dynamics on the shoot (i.e., leaf number, life span, and birth rate), while other approaches predicted that one or more parameters would be infinite. This formulation of the model also predicted that leaves should be maintained on the shoot until the diurnal carbon balance declines to zero, in contrast with other scenarios which predict that leaves should be shed while maintaining a positive carbon balance. Predictions of the model were supported by the results of a field study of carbon gain and leaf dynamics in saplings of three species of tropical pioneer trees (Carica papaya, Cecropia obtusifolia, and Hampea nutricia) which differ in the number of leaves per shoot. The results illustrate that in these fast-growing plants, leaf production and height growth may be more appropriate measures of performance than net carbon export from the shoot, and suggest that leaf senescence is primarily a function of the position of a leaf within the canopy, rather than its chronological age},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the evolution of leaf size, sapling canopy allometry, and related traits in 17 Acer species growing in the understory of temperate deciduous forests, using parsimony methods, randomization tests, and independent contrasts calculated on a phylogeny inferred from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Bivariate correlations and multivariate analyses indicated two independent suites of coevolving traits, and the results were robust over a range of alternative phylogenies. The first suite consisted of strong positive correlations among twig thickness, leaf size, inflorescence length, and branch spacing (Corner's rules). Seed size and mature height were also weakly correlated with these traits. The second suite reflected aspects of sapling crown allometry, including crown size, stem diameter, and total leaf area, which appear to be related to shade tolerance. There was a weak negative correlation between sapling crown size and mature height, but no correlation with leaf or seed size. Most correlations were similar in magnitude for ahistorical and independent contrasts analyses, and discrepancies between these two measures were greater in traits with lower levels of convergent evolution. The evolutionary correlations among twig, leaf, seed, inflorescence, and canopy dimensions emphasize the need for integrated theories of evolution and function of these disparate traits},

  Abstract                 = {The use of mangrove prop roots and associated coralline habitats by Caribbean spiny lobsters was investigated near two types of mangrove islands in Belize. Spiny lobsters sheltered among mangrove prop roots, in undercut peat banks and under corals near islands, and they ranged in size from newly recruited juveniles to subadults. Lobsters preferred to shelter under large stony corals, but their use of mangrove prop roots nd undercut peat banks increased when the density of corals was low. Den residence time and distance moved within a site were similar at islands isolated by deep water channels and islands separated by shallow seagrass beds, but as a consequence of high immigration rates, population sizes were highest near shallow islands. Predation on newly settled juveniles was greater in seagrass and coral crevices than in mangrove prop roots, whereas the survival of larger juveniles was higher in mangroves and coral patch reefs than in seagrass. These results suggest that mangrove habitats may function as a nursery for juvenile spiny lobsters but that the use of this habitat depends on shelter characteristics and the isolation of islands},

  Abstract                 = {Various ecophysiological investigations are presented in Aldrovanda vesiculosa, a rootless aquatic carnivorous plant. A distinct polarity of N, P, and Ca tissue content per dry mass (DM) unit was found along Aldrovanda shoots. Due to effective re-utilization, relatively small proportions of N (10 - 13 %) and P (33 - 43 %) are probably lost with senescent leaf whorls, while there is complete loss of all Ca, K, and Mg. The total content of starch and free sugars was 26 - 47 % DM along adult shoots, with the maximum in the 7(th) - 10(th) whorls. About 30 % of the total maximum sugar content was probably lost with dead whorls. The plant was found to take up 5 - 7 times more NH4+ to NO3- from a mineral medium. Under nearly-natural conditions in an outdoor cultivation container, catching of prey led to significantly more rapid growth than in unfed plants. DM of the fed controls was 48 % higher than in the unfed plants. The controls produced 0.69 branches per plant, while the unfed plants did not produce any. However, the N and P content per DM unit increased by 6 - 25 % in the apices and the first 6 whorls in the unfed variant, as compared to the fed controls. It may be suggested that carnivory is very important for Aldrovanda},

Two species, Cnephia eremites Shewell and Cnephia pallipes (Fries), accounted for more than 97% of the total number of captured black flies. By virtue of their large populations, site fidelity at lake outfalls, and concentrated activity near the ground, these flies provide a predictable supply of prey that could affect the fitness of streamside carnivorous plants},

  Abstract                 = {Northern peatlands are important sources of carbon dioxide and methane emissions to the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric N deposition may have a significant impact on the emission of these greenhouse gases. We studied CO2 and CH4 emissions from untreated temperate pc at soils from a eutrophic and a mesotrophic Fen in a high N deposition area (the Netherlands) and from a mesotrophic fen in a low N deposition area (north-cast Poland). In addition, we investigated the effects of N, P and glucose amendments on the emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these soils. Nitrogen availability (extractable NH4+) in untreated pent from the high N area was 2.5-7.5 times higher than in the low N area, whereas the pH was 0.9-1.7 units lower. Using 6- week laboratory incubations of peat columns, we found that mean daily CO2 emission from untreated peat soils from the high N area was lower than that from the low N area. Both linear and multiple regression analysis shelved that CO2 emission was positively related to soil pH (r(2) = 0.64). Additional N supply led to pn reduction and to lower CO2 emission, especially in the low N peat soils. Thus, increased atmospheric N deposition lends, probably as a result of soil acidification, to fewer CO2 emission. Although glucose amendments resulted in increased CO2 and CH4 emission, we did not find evidence that this was caused by increased mineralization of native pest. Mean daily CH4-C emission was about 1-2 orders of magnitude lons},

Biomass, frequency of occurrence and relative cover of the species along a belt transect, showed two major trends, a decrease in these parameters in the landward direction for Colpomenia sp. Gracilaria blodgettii and Gracilaria crassa and an increase in the landward direction for Dictyota dichotoma, Catenella nipae, Rhizoclonium sp. and Bostrichia radicans. Algal dominance varied with substratum. Pneumatophores were dominated by Caloglossa lepreurii and sediment surface by D. dichotoma. The 40 cm zone at the base of tree trunks was dominated by two algal species. The 0-20 cm region above the sediment surface was colonized by C. nipae, while the 20-40 cm region was dominated by Rhizoclonium sp. The study identified the importance of substrate in macroalgal colonization},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA XF268 Akhani H, Univ Munich, Inst Systemat Bot, Menzinger Str 67, D- 80638 Munich, GERMANY English Article Photosynthetic pathways are reported for 305 species of Chenopodiaceae from Africa, Asia and Europe. Ecological characteristics, phytogeography and life forms of all species are given, and their correlation with relevant CO2- fixation types are discussed. 205 species (67.2%) exhibit the C-4-pathway and 100 species (32.8%) the C-3-pathway of CO2-fixation. Most of the C-4 species are of Irano-Turanian origin. The diversity of C-4 species of the Irano-Turanian phytochoria, with very harsh winters, are interpreted by the active period of Chenopods in summer. There is a close relationship between some special morphotypes and respective photosynthetic type. Halophytes and xerophytes with articulated stems and stem succulents of Anabasis- type are exclusively C-4 Leaf succulent halophytes and xerohalophytes are predominantly C-4. Hygrohalophytes with leaf or stem succulence are often C-3. Probably many C-4 Salsoleae have been evolved in the Afroasiatic arid zone after the climatic changes of the Miocene. Among them there is a high proportion of annuals that have a younger origin. There is some evidence that the present Chenopods of the subfamily ''Salsoboideae'' may have their ancient stock in NW Africa, We found close taxonomic relationships between photosynthetic pathways and infrageneric classification in genera with both types of C-3 and C-4, like Atriplex and Suaeda},

Relationships between the body mass changes and the ecogeographic picture of Equini evolution are also analysed. The metapodial and phalanx variables, particularly antero-posterior diameters, are better correlated with body mass than cranial variables in living Equini. Large sized species are correlated with cold climates, open habitats and/or soft soils; small ones are correlated with warm climates, more closed habitats and/or hard soils. Pleistocene horses from Europe and Africa follow an evolutionary trend opposite to their North American counterparts, From larger sized species to smaller ones.

A variety of factors affect the frequency of occurrence of these fungi, e.g. salinity, length of exposure of substrate, wood species and location within the mangrove. Two aspects are addressed in this paper: a) Comparison of the fungi present at three mangroves in Malaysia (Morib, Kuala Selangor, Port Dickson); and b) The fungi colonising specific mangrove wood, e.g. Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. Species diversity was greatest at Port Dickson with 63 fungi recorded while species composition varied from site to site. Common fungi at Morib and Kuala Selangor were Halocyphina villosa and Leptosphaeria australiensis along with Kallichroma tethys and Lulworthia grandispora at the latter site. None of these were common at Port Dickson, the dominant species at this site were Hypoxylon oceanicum and Massarina ramunculicola. A comparison of the fungi occurring on Avicennia marina and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza indicated that Halocyphina villosa was common on both timbers. Species diversity and abundance were greatest on Avicennia with the following fungi listed as common: Eutypa sp., Kallichroma tethys, Marinosphaera mangrovei, Phoma sp. and Julelia avicenniae},

  Abstract                 = {Prior to the early 1900s, there were no mangroves in the Hawaiian Archipelago. In 1902, Rhizophora mangle was introduced on the island of Molokai, primarily for the purpose of stabilizing coastal mud flats. This species is now well established in Hawaii. And is found on nearly all of the major islands. At least five other species of mangroves or associated species were introduced to Hawaii in the early 1900s and while none has thrived to the degree of R. Mangle, at least two have established self-maintaining populations (Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Conocarpus erectus). Mangroves are highly regarded in most parts of the tropics for the ecosystem services they provide, but in Hawaii they also have important negative ecological and economic impacts. Known negative impacts include reduction in habitat quality for endangered waterbirds such as the Hawaiian stilt (Himantopus mexicanus knudseni), colonization of habitats to the detriment of native species (e.g. In anchialine pools), overgrowing native Hawaiian archaeological sites, and causing drainage and aesthetic problems. Positive impacts appear to be fewer, but include uses of local importance, such as harvesting B. Gymnorrhiza flowers for lei-making, as well as some ecological services attributed to mangroves elsewhere, such as sediment retention and organic matter export. From a research perspective. Possible benefits of the presence of mangroves in Hawaii include an unusual opportunity to evaluate      = {1997},

  Abstract                 = {Studies on the historical development of mangrove wetlands are rare in contrast to the vast array of information on the geological development of these systems. Historical development of the Port Royal mangal was investigated so as improve understanding of recent changes occurring in relation to the increasing threat of sea level rise to their existence. The historical development of the Port Royal mangal, Jamaica, began with the first documented spatial record for the area in 1692 and traced to 1991 using historical maps and aerial photographs. The mangrove system is a fringe mangrove community type, composed of primarily Rhizophora mangle L. Located along the northern shore of the Palisadoes, which is a composite tombolo on the south coast of Jamaica. A general trend was determined for the morphology of the mangal which showed relative stability, displaying little significant variation in its areal extent over a period of 300 years. The horizontal extension by colonizing mangroves has not been significant, with forested areas being restricted to sharply defined geomorphological units, probably because of the response of the system to a combination of factors. These include: i. A small tidal range; ii. Geomorphology of the system; iii, a lack of large sediment inputs and iv. Episodic events such as hurricanes. This stability of the Port Royal mangrove system is atypical of the understanding of development of these wetlands, which has been accepte   = {SALIX, HERBIVORY, PLANT-INSECT},

  Abstract                 = {I report a simulation study that tested the ability of a variety of experimental designs to achieve two fundamental goals: (1) to determine the association between loss of biological diversity and responses such as ecosystem functioning and (2) to determine which components of biodiversity, such as number of species, functional diversity, or a keystone species, were most responsible for that association. For the goal of reliably detecting an overall association, all designs I tested! performed well and were unlikely to misidentify predominant patterns. Thus, this study affirms the common conclusion of many published biodiversity experiments that loss of biological diversity is often associated with a reduction in ecosystem functioning. However, for the goal of identifying the components of biodiversity that are most responsible for the effects,, designs differed markedly. Some designs performed well in detecting number-of-species effects but poorly in detecting effects of unique species or functional groups. No design tested was able to discriminate both numeric effects and compositional effects in all situations. Thus, this study demonstrates that interpreting results about: mechanisms from biodiversity experiments will be critically dependent on an experiment's design},

The establishment of a new marsh community was followed at this site from 1987 to 1991. Seedling survival was relatively low with only 5% surviving for a year or longer. Seedlings which did become successfully established rapidly by expanded vegetative growth. Salicornia virginica, Frankenia grandifolia and Distichlis spicata were the most successful species occupying at least 20% cover across most of the study area, bat other species became established as well. Seedling survival and plant establishment were greatest in 1989 following heavy spring rains which provided large inputs of fresh water. Disturbances followed by conditions that lower stress, which would otherwise pre ent germination and growth, are important for the rapid establishment of a marsh at Bolinas},

  Abstract                 = {A regional synopsis of the genus Blakea is presented that recognizes 33 species in Mexico and Central America. This summary includes a key, distributional and phenological information, notes on morphological variation, and discussions that provide rationale for relegating six binomials to synonymy. Descriptions and diagnoses are presented for four new species of Blakea (B. Coloradensis, B. Darcyana, and B. Perforata, from Panama; and B. Wilsoniorum from southern Costa Rica and Panama). Analysis of the type specimens and recently collected flowering material of Topobea storkii necessitates its transfer to Blakea. Three other species (B. Cuatrecasii, B. Repens, and B. Subconnata var. Obtusa), all of which were previously known from Andean South America, are reported from Panama for the first time},

They are concerned primarily with individual species within defined "communities" (areas dominated by a single species). The point of the paper is to infer competitive exclusion (based on Grimean triangles and "species characteristics" [ruderal, stress, competitive, but otherwise vague]). As far as I'm concerned, it is a big leap from observed phenological data to asserting that competition is a driving force in these communities. While I appreciate that this is one of those "classic" papers cited in most reviews of phenology, species groupings, and competition, the conclusions are only weakly supported by the data. The data are strong, but they don't convince me of anything other than the fact that different species grow at different times. Anything else must be resolved experimentally.},

  Abstract                 = {This review assesses the degree of resilience of mangrove forests to large, infrequent disturbance (tsunamis) and their role in coastal protection, and to chronic disturbance events (climate change) and the future of mangroves in the face of global change. From a geological perspective, mangroves come and go at considerable speed with the current distribution of forests a legacy of the Holocene, having undergone almost chronic disturbance as it result of fluctuations in sea-level. Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution. This notion is supported by evidence that soil accretion rates in mangrove forests are currently keeping pace with mean sea-level rise. Further support for their resilnd highly efficient biotic controls, self-design and redundancy of keystone species, and numerous feedbacks, all contribute to mangrove resilience to various types of disturbance.

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA TW026 Alongi DM, Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, AUSTRALIA English Article Variations in benthic nutrient pools and rates of dissolved nutrient exchange between the forest floor and tidal waters were examined over a 5-yr period in mixed Rhizophora forests lining Coral Creek on Hinchinbrook Island in Queensland, Australia. Seasonal and spatial changes in redox status, porewater and solid- phase nutrients, and in exchange rates were not consistent and did not correlate with temperature. Below-ground roots, on average, accounted for similar to 79%, 37% and 26% of bulk sediment TOC, total N and total P pools, respectively. Porewater nutrient concentrations were dominated by Si(OH)(4)(+) and DON with consistently low levels of NO2- + NO3-. At most sampling periods, porewater NH4+ and PO43- concentrations were higher in creek bank sediments than in mangrove sediments indicating uptake by trees. These sediments have low adsorption capacity (K = 0.17- 0.47) for NH4+, but a moderate capacity (K = 0.8-4.8) for PO43- adsorption. Most measured benthic fluxes of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus showed uptake by sediments, prop roots and timber lying on the forest floor. Relative (per ha) estimates indicate that low-intertidal Rhizophora forests import similar to 2220 mmol N ha(-1)d(-1) and similar to 496 mmol P ha(-1)d(-1), with sediments accounting for nearly all uptake while Si is exported (similar to 2475 mmol ha(-1)d(-1). Mid-intertidal forests import similar to 1385, 93 and 4720 mmol ha(-1)d(-1) of N, P and Si, respectively; sediments, prop roots and timber respectively account for 36%, 62% and 2% of the N import. Mid-intertidal sediments account for all net P uptake, but prop roots and sediments account for 60% and 40% of total Si uptake. On an absolute basis, low-intertidal forests (78 ha total area) in Coral Creek import similar to 881 kgN yr(-1), 436 kgP yr(-1) and export 1963 kgSi yr(-1), and the mid- intertidal forests (338 ha total area) import similar to 2392 kgN yr(-1), 356 kgP yr(-1) and 16300 kgSi yr(-1). The sum of these estimates equates to similar to 95% of the net annual import of total dissolved N and similar to 66% of the net annual import of total dissolved P into the Coral Creek tidal basin from adjacent coastal waters. By difference, similar to 14337 kgSi yr(-1) is imported into the system. This indicates that mangrove forests are a very efficient sink of dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon in this tidally-driven coastal ecosystem. This import may be driven by the consistently high rates of microbial and plant growth and productivity within the forests},

  Comment                  = {AB- Sedimentary bacteria have generally been recognized as an essential food for protists and invertebrates, forming the base of benthic food webs. This trophic role has been well documented, but bacteria play an equally important role as mineralizers of organic detritus and recyclers of essential nutrients. Recent evidence suggests that this latter role is more important than their trophic function in tropical mangrove and coastal sediments. Bacteria in these systems are, on average, more abundant and productive than their counterparts in higher- latitude systems. They account for a disproportionate share of nutrient uptake to the extent that bacterial communities act as a sink for carbon, processing most of the energy and nutrients in tropical aquatic systems. Most bacteria remain unconsumed in tropical deposits, dying naturally and lysing, with the next generation of cells consuming, mineralizing and recycling this material either into new biomass or dissolved material. Bacteria in tropical aquatic sediments are ultimately controlled by inputs of dissolved and particulate detritus, natural mortality and recycling. To replenish damaged ecosystems in the tropics, restoration of the natural geochemical profile in the sediments is necessary to re-initiate the growth of bacteria in order to restore the essential recycling processes which assist in the conservation of nutrients},

In a deltaic forest, rates of sediment respiration ranged from 197 to 1645 mu mol O-2 m(-2) h(-1) (mean=836), but did not vary significantly with season or intertidal zone. Gross primary production varied among intertidal zones and seasons, ranging from -281 to 1413 mu mol O-2 m(-2) h(-1) (mean=258). Upon tidal exposure, rates of gross primary production increased, but respiration rates did not change significantly. In a fringing mangrove forest, benthic respiration and gross primary production exhibited strong seasonality. In both forests, rates of oxygen consumption and production were low compared to salt marshes, but equivalent to rates in other mangrovygen, sediment, lagoons, benthic ecology, respiration, Great Barrier Reef},

Particulate C and N concentrations ranged from 2-8% and 0.15-0.36% by sediment dry weight (DW) with few depth differences between ponds. Pyrite was abundant (0.3-5.6% of sediment DW) in both ponds. Total carbon oxidation rates were not significantly different between the pond located separate from mangroves (separate pond) and the pond located within a mangrove forest (mixed pond). Fluxes of O-2 and CO2 (= total carbon oxidation, T-COX) were highly variable, with slow rates of CO2 release (range: 7.7-30.5 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) but higher rates of O-2 consumption (range: 9.8-135.9 mmol m(-2) day(-1)), especially in the separate pond. A budget of the contribution of the various diagenetic pathways to total methane flux was detected from sediments of either pond. Rates of sulfate reduction were slow (range: 0.94-2.73 mmol S m(-2) day(-1)) and highly variable, accounting for 13-26% of T- COX. Rates of solute flux across the sediment-water interface were dominated by DOC, NO2- NO3-, and Mn. There was no measurable NH4+ flux. Most light-dark bottle O-2 fluxes indicated no net benthic primary productivity. The slow rates of benthic decomposition and the dominance of oxic and suboxic pathways reflect the slow rates of organic matter input, and phytoplankton and shrimp production in these extensive ponds.

  Abstract                 = {Twenty-seven species of marine sponges belonging to Axinellidae and related groups (Halichondriidae, Dictyonellidae, Agelasida) were selected to test the monophyly of Axinellidae and investigate their phylogenetic relationships using parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. Partial 28S rDNA sequences, including the D3 domain, and traditional morphological characters (mainly skeletal ones) were used independently to construct phylogenetic trees. Sequences were aligned using the appropriate model of secondary structure of the RNA and compared to that produced by the multiple sequence alignment program, ClustalW. The alignment using secondary structure constraints produced a better estimate of the phylogeny and was demonstrated to be an effective and objective method. Results of the cladistic analyses of the molecular and morphological data sets were not fully congruent; the morphological data suggest that Axinellidae is monophyletic, however, the molecular data suggest that it is nonmonophyletic. The single most-parsimonious tree derived from the molecular data showed that species of Axinella (except A. Polypoides) are united in a clade that is more closely related to members of Agelasida than to other species of Axinellidae; the remaining members of Axinellidae form a monophyletic group that is closely related to the families Dictyonellidae and Halichondriidae. The consensus tree of 20 most-parsimonious trees from the morphological analysis, on the other hand, showed that all the sampled species of Axinellidae belong to a monophyletic group which is closely related to the species of Dictyonellidae and Halichondriidae. Only two branches were identical in both cladograms, the one uniting the species of Ptilocaulis and Reniochalina and the one with the species of Dictyonellidae. The robustness of the molecular and morphological trees (or parts of the trees), was tested using bootstrap, jack-knife, PTP and T-PTP tests. The results of the PTP test were significant indicating significant cladistic structure in both data sets. The bootstrap and jack-knife values indicate that the molecular tree is in general better supported than the morphological one. The lack of morphological characters and the homoplastic nature of some may explain the weak support of the morphological tree. A T-PTP test of nonmonophyly showed that the nonmonophyly of Axinellidae, as indicated by the results of the molecular analysis, is not significant; however, a T-PTP test of monophyly of Axinellidae, as indicated by the morphological tree, produced significant results. This indicates that the monophyly of Axinellidae based on morphological data cannot be rejected; the family however, cannot be defined in terms of a unique diagnostic character common to all members of the ingroup. Tests of heterogeneity (reciprocal T-PTP and partition homogeneity test) indicated that the data partitions are heterogeneous, which could be due to sampling errors (in either data set) or differences in the underlying phylogenies; therefore data were not combined in a single analysis. Further, both data sets are unequally sized (95 informative molecular characters vs. 16 informative morphological characters), which means that the molecular signal could swamp the morphological signal if the data is combined. Nonmonophyly of Axinellidae is supported by chemical and genetic evidence available in the literature and DNA sequences data of axinellid species from New Zealand. However, this needs to be confirmed using independent evidence from different genes (or gene regions), biochemistry, histology or cell ultrastructure. Therefore, no changes to the taxonomic position of the family in the higher classification are proposed at this stage},

  Abstract                 = {Tococa myrmecophytes develop swollen domatia to house ants at the base of their leaves. We measured the amount of herbivory in Tococa spadaciflora and T. Guianensis with and without their associated ants during eight months in a primary rain forest of the central coast of Colombian Choco. We evaluated 87 individual plants in three 900m(2) plots that were separated by at least 300m. More than 90% of all plants of both species were occupied by Pheidole sp., but four more ant species, Azteca sp., Brachymyrmex heeri, Crematogaster sp. And Wasmannia auropunctata, also inhabited the plants' domatia. We excluded the ants from half of randomly chosen plants and measured two response variables: herbivory (25% of the leaves/plant) and number of leaves/ plant, during three consecutive events separated by four months. Tococa spadaciflora was found to be highly susceptible to the absence of its associated ants, as demonstrated by a significant final average herbivory of 91% in the ant-excluded plants vs. 27% in the control plants. T. Guianensis showed a smaller but also significantly higher percent herbivory (55% vs. 22% respectively). Each plant was occupied by a single ant species, with an average of 74 and 62 ants per plant for T. Spadaciflora and T. Guianensis respectively. We discuss the implications of finding two Tococa myrmecophilous species living in the same location, and lodging the same mutualist ants but differing in their dependance upon the defensive action of the ants. The ants functionally stratified the plant according to the location of the leaves: the brood chambers and reproductive caste were located in young leaves, while storage material, seeds, garbage and arthropod corpses were located in the lower and old leaves. Live insects, such as Staphylinidae (SE Aleocharinae) beetles, coccids, tipulids and small crustaceans were also found inside domatia. We directly observed defensive actions of Pheidole ants against several arthropods, including the major defoliator in the region, Atta cephalotes},

  Abstract                 = {We review deterministic and stochastic demographic models as well as cal population genetic models that have been applied to tropical rain forest tree species. We discuss their implications for conservation. The main conclusions of deterministic demographic models are the key importance of species' longevity in determining susceptibility of population growth rate to harvesting of individuals at different life- stages, the critical effect of patch dynamics, and the importance of density-dependent mechanisms at least for abundant species. Population viability analysis to predict extinction times of tropical rain forest tree species has only been performed for four tropical rain forest tree species using the simplest Lefkovitch matrix linear model. Results obtained are in accordance with results of simple stochastic models for nonstructured populations that have been solved analytically. Population genetic models have shown that tropical rain forest trees: (a) possess high levels of genetic diversity, (b) maintain greater proportions of genetic variation within than among populations, (c) are predominantly outcrossed, and (d) have high levels of gene flow. These results suggest that tropical tree species may not be in immediate danger of extinction from genetic factors if actual conditions are maintained. However, the impact of forest fragmentation is expected to be particularly strong for most tropical rain forest tree species due mainly to the high genetic load kept by their present population genetic structures. Recent theoretical demographic-genetic models for simple systems suggest that the fixation of new mildly detrimental mutations may be comparable in importance to environmental stochasticity, implying minimum viable populations as large as a few thousands. It is urgent to develop a model that integrates genetic and demographic factors, that enables evaluations of their relative importance in long-term persistence of tropical rain forest tree species},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the processes that maintain diversity has been the focus of extensive study, yet there is much that has not been integrated into a cohesive framework. First, there is a separation of perspective. Ecological and evolutionary approaches to diversity have progessed in largely parallel directions. Second, there is a separation of emphasis. In both ecology and population genetics, classical theories favour local explanations with emphasis on population dynamics and selection within populations, while contemporary theories favour spatial explanations, with emphasis on population structure and interactions among populations. What is lacking is a comparative approach that evaluates the relative importance of local and spatial processes in maintaining genetic and ecological diversity. I present a framework for diversity maintenance that emphasizes the comparative approach. I use a well-known but little-used mathematical approach, the perturbation theorem for dynamical systems, to identify key points of contact between ecological and population genetic theories of coexistence. These connections provide for a synthesis of several important concepts: population structure (source- sink versus extinction-colonization), spatial heterogeneity (intrinsic versus extrinsic) in fitness and competitive ability, and temporal scales over which local and spatial processes influence diversity. This framework ties together a large and diverse body of theory and data from ecology and population genetics. It yields comparative predictions that can serve as guidelines in biodiversity management. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London},

  Abstract                 = {Since returning an ecosystem to its pristine state may not be realistic in every situation, the concept of habitat diversity is proposed to help decision-makers in defining realistic restoration objectives. In order to maintain habitat diversity and enhance the long-term success of restoration, process- oriented projects should be preferred to species-oriented ones. Because the hydrogeomorphological processes that influence biodiversity operate at different spatiotemporal scales, three scales are considered: river sectors, floodplain waterbodies, and mesohabitats within each water-body. Based on a bibliographical review, three major driving forces are proposed for incorporation into the design of restoration projects: (1) flow velocity and flood disturbances, (2) hydrological connectivity, and (3) water supply. On the sector scale, increased habitat diversity between waterbodies can be achieved by combining various intensities of these driving forces. On the waterbody scale, increased habitat diversity within the ecosystem can be achieved by varying water depth, velocity, and substrate. The concept is applied to a Rhone River sector (France) where three terrestrialized side arms will be restored, Two were designed to be flood scoured, one having an additional supply of groundwater, the other being connected to the river at both ends, The third cannot be scoured by floods because of upstream construction and would be supplied by river backflow through a downstream connection. Habitat diversity within the ecosystem is exemplified on one side arm through the design of a sinuous pathway combined with variation of water depth, wetted width, and substrate grain size.

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA A system is proposed whereby ant functional groups are used as structural attributes to classify ninety-four Australian ant communities in a manner analogous to the classification of vegetation according to predominant life- forms. In terms of their responses to stress and disturbance, Dominant Dolichoderinae (DD) are considered analogous to trees, functionally subdominant Generalized Myrmicinae (GM) to shrubs and ruderal Opportunists (OPP) to grasses. Community types DDO (twenty-two sites), DD1 (twenty-two sites), DD2 (eight sites), DD3 (thirty-nine sites) and DD4 (three sites), respectively, are defined as having the relative abundance of Dominant Dolichoderinae <10%, 10-19%, 20-29%, 30-70% and >90%. They are structurally analogous to treeless plant communities, open woodlands, woodlands, forests and plantations, respectively. DDO communities are classified as DD0GM (analogous to shrublands) when Generalized Myrmicinae predominate, DD0OPP (analogous to grasslands) when Opportunists predominate and DD0CS (analogous to cold- adapted heathlands) when neither functional group is abundant. Similarly, the relative abundances of Generalized Myrmicinae and Opportunists are used to classify DD1-3 communities in a manner analogous to the classification of woodlands and open forests according to understorey type. DD3OPP communities, for example, where the relative abundance of Dominant Dolichoderinae is 30- 70% and Opportunists are predominant among remaining ants, are structurally analogous to grassy forests. The distribution of ant functional groups is considered in relation to stress and disturbance by adopting Grime's (1979) triangular ordination concepts and nomenclature, with ant community structural types being analysed in terms of the relative importance of competition, stress and disturbance as factors regulating community structure. DD0 and DD1 structural types are stress-tolerant, or ruderal, communities; DD2 and DD3 types are competitive communities when Generalized Myrmicinae are abundant, and competitive ruderal or competitive stress-tolerant ruderal when Opportunists are predominant among non- dolichoderines; and DD4 communities are competitive ruderal. In temperate regions, seasonal changes in ant community structure parallel those occurring along biogeographical gradients spanning comparable temperature regimes. A positive relationship was found between the abundance of functionally dominant ants (DD + GM) and species richness. Plant and ant communities often differ from each other in their responses to the same stress or disturbance, such that there is often a poor correspondence between ant and plant community structural type at any particular site Article},

Halobates Eschscholtz, are the only insects to have successfully colonized the open ocean. In addition, 38 species are found in sheltered coastal waters throughout tropical Indo-Pacific. The taxonomy of the genus is relatively well known, and the phylogenetic relationships between errant species have recently been analysed (using cladistic methodHalobates ruffoi sp. nov., from the Eocene deposit 'Pesciara di Bolca', in the province of Verona, northeastern Italy (geological age about 45 Myr). The significance of this fossil in setting the time scale for the reconstructed phylogeny and anagenesis of adaptive features of sea skaters, and in understanding the evolution and historical zoogeography of these marine insects is discussed},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA The effect of four substrata (concrete, plywood, fibreglass and aluminium) on the recruitment of species and development of an intertidal estuarine fouling assemblage was examined in Quibray Bay of Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Many species, including the oyster Saccostrea commercialis (Iredale & Roughley) and the barnacles Hexaminius sp., Balanus amphitrite Darwin and Balanus variegatus Darwin, recruited in greater numbers on concrete or plywood surfaces than on fibreglass or aluminium. As a result, patterns of change in the number of species through time were dependent on the substratum. Multivariate analyses indicated that assemblages on different substrata were significantly different after 1 or 2 months of submersion, but became more similar after longer periods (up to 4-5 months). The reasons for this gradual conformity varied depending on the season of submersion and the composition of the species settling in a particular season. The results of this study indicated that the nature of the substratum can affect both initial colonisation of particular species and the development of the assemblage over time. Because the effect of substratum varies with the period of submersion, comparisons of various studies on fouling assemblages using different natural and artificial substrata and for varying lengths of time are likely to be very difficult},

Progress in this is exemplified by reference t o the reinstatement of traditional management, the problems assoc iated with reducing loadings, and the control of invasive alien s pecies. Habitat repair after damaging activities is illustrated t hrough discussion of advances in dwarf-shrub heath and grassland re-establishment. It is concluded that a wealth of knowledge is n ow available on which to base appropriate action, and that, provi ded the desired species persist, restoration is, to some extent, achievable. Some of the principles involved in habitat creation a re outlined. Provided these are observed, such establishment can play a vital role in nature conservation, although there is scope for more innovative schemes and basic research into some of tderson, R.C. and Loucks, O.L.},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA A quantitative survey of species composition and diversity along depth gradients at Discovery Bay, Jamaica, in 1992 indicated that coral cover was less than or equal to 5% at all depths, except at 30 m, where it attained 27%. Percent cover by macroalgae ranged from 44 to 79% over the entire reef, with highest values between 5 and 20 m on the fore reef. Coral diversity increased with depth between a low at reef crest to a maximum of 0.96 (Brillouin's index, H) at 30 m. Total species diversity was highest at the back reef site (2.32). Coral cover at shallow depths (1, 5, and 15 m) was an order of magnitude lower than in 1982. Such striking changes in community structure over the past decade indicate how physical and biological perturbations (e.g. hurricanes, reduced urchin populations and fish grazing) have affected the reef},

The mites are common prey of such plants, but we have found a new subspecies of the mite Oribatula tibialis living on the leaves of Pinguicula longifolia. Because of its small size and the low glandular density of the host, the mite moves without being trapped by the mucilaginous droplets of the leaf surface. P. longifolia provides shelter and food for the mite, while the plant may also benefit because of its fungivorous and scavenging activities. This new interaction is another dramatic example of widespread mite- plant associations},

(Coleoptera Apio nidae) galls on Diospyrus hispida DC (Ebenaceae) was studied in a cerrado (savanna) area in southeastern Brazil. We asked the foll owing questions: (a) what ant species occupy the galls, (b) are t here any relationships among gall occupation, plant height, and g all distance from the ground, and (c) do ants differentially sele ct galls? Seven ant species were found: Camponotus sp. 1 and Camp onotus sp. 2, Crematogaster brevispinosa (Mayr 1870), Zacryptocer us pusillus (Klug 1824), Pseudomyrmex gracilis (Fabricius 1804), Solenopsis sp., and Leptothorax sp. Plant height, distance of the gall to the ground, gall volume, number of channels inside the g alls, the length of ant's body and the width of ant's head were r ecorded. Antaellison},

The effects of supplemental hand-pollination and resource addition on the reproductive output of the self-fertile gynodioecious perennial Geranium sylvaticum (Geraniaceae) were tested for several populations that differ in their female frequency (4.4-23.0%).

  Abstract                 = {The outcomes of press perturbation experiments on community dynamics are difficult to predict because there is a high degree of indeterminacy in the strength and direction of ecological interactions. Ecologists need to quantify uncertainties in estimates of interaction strength, by determining all the possible values a given interaction strength could lake and the relative likelihood of each value. In this study, we assess the degree to which fish effects on zooplankton and phytoplankton are indeterminate in direction using a combination of experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations. Based on probability distributions of interaction strength (i.e. Effect magnitude), we estimated the probability of each fish interaction being negative, positive or undetermined in direction. We then investigated how interaction strength and its predictability might vary with experimental duration and the taxonomic resolution of food web data. Results show that most effects of fish on phyto- and zooplankton were indeed indeterminate, and that the effects of fish were more predictable in direction as the taxonomic resolution of food web data decreased and the experimental duration increased. Results also show that most distributions of interaction strength were not normal, suggesting that normal based statistical procedures for testing hypothesis about interaction strength may be misleading, as well as predictions of food web models assuming normal distributions of interaction strength. By considering the probability distributions and confidence intervals of interaction parameters, ecologists would better understand the outcomes of species interactions and make more realistic predictions about our perturbations in natural food webs},

  Comment                  = {AB- Published predictions of the impacts of sea level rise on mangroves are too simplistic, due to the assumption that ecosystem structure and plant zonation are uniform. Field survey and analysis of over 200 coastal wetland sites in the Insular Caribbean suggests the likelihood of very variable system responses, because of the wide range of wetland types and geomorphic settings. A template is presented for use in predicting site-specific responses to sea level change in mangrove and associated coastal wetlands. Significant predictors are site physiography and relation to neighbouring coastal systems, plus the immediate hinterland and recent changes to wetlands resulting from human intervention. Impacts on mangroves may include some losses, but inland migration, change in species dominance, and increase in area are more likely in the short term, depending on the range of site characteristics. This is supported by review of palaeoecological studies on wetland development in the region. The use of the template in coastal area planning and engineering is discussed},

  Comment                  = {AB- Seed bank dynamics of the short-lived perennial halophyte Hordeum jubatum L. and the annual halophytes Atriplex triangularis Willd. and Salicornia europaea L. were examined in three zones of an inland saline marsh near Rittman, Ohio. The seed bank was assayed using a sequence of temperature treatments to satisfy the germination requirements of all species. Viable seeds of H. jubatum and other halophytes persisted in the soil seed bank after the normal spring germination season. Total seed bank ranged from 479,200 seeds/m2 to 85,925 seeds/m2. However, seeds of H. jubatum usually comprised less than 30% of the seeds in the total seed bank for the three zones of the marsh in which it occurred during the sampling period from February 1987 to November 1988. Atriplex triangularis also produced a persistent seed bank in each of the three zones. We concluded that H. jubatum is less dependent on a large seed bank for maintaining its population than are the annual halophytes because it is a short-lived perennial},

Water samples also were analyzed from 16 of these sites and from 9 sites at which no sponges were detected to characterize sponge habitats chemically. Three species of sponges were identified: Ephydatia muelleri (Em), Eunapius fragilis (Ef), and Spangilla lacustris (Sl). A 4th type of specimen was present at 2 sites but could not be identified because of the absence of gemmules and gemmoscleres. At 46% of the sites containing sponges, more than 1 specimen type was present. Sponges were most commonly found near outlets of lakes, attached to sides or undersides of submerged rocks and logs. They appeared as encrusting (Em, Ef, Sl), lobate (Em), and fingerlike (Sl) growths, varying in color from light tan to green. Dimensions of the spicules varied greatly within each species and expanded previously recorded ranges. No factors limiting sponge distribution were identified, but ranges of conductivity (Em) and of silica (Em, Sl), calcium (Em), and magnesium (Em) concentrations were expanded beyond those reported previously},

To help improve our understanding of such atmosphere-biosphere interactions, we explored changes in leaf-level photosynthesis in a 60-70 yr old temperate mixed-deciduous forest in Petersham, Massachusetts (USA).

  Abstract                 = {Within the same forest, photosynthesis can vary greatly among species and within an individual tree. Quantifying the magnitude of variation in leaf-level photosynthesis in a forest canopy will improve our understanding of and ability to model forest carbon cycling. This information requires extensive sampling of photosynthesis in the canopy. We used a 22-m-tall, four-wheel-drive aerial lift to reach five to ten leaves from the tops of numerous individuals of several species of temperate deciduous trees in central Massachusetts. The goals of this study were to measure light-saturated photosynthesis in co-occurring canopy tree species under field conditions, and to identify sampling schemes appropriate for canopy tree studies with challenging logistics. Photosynthesis differed significantly among species. Even though all leaves measured were canopy-top, sun-acclimated foliage, the more shade- tolerant species tended to have lower light-saturated photosynthetic rates (P-max) than the shade-intolerant species. Likewise, leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content (N) varied significantly between species. With only one exception, the shade-tolerant species tended to have lower nitrogen content on an area basis than the intolerant species, although the LMA did not differ systematically between these ecological types. Light-saturated P-max rates and nitrogen content, both calculated on either an area or a mass basis, and the leaf mass to area ratio, significantly differed not only among species, but also among individuals within species (P<0.0001 for both). Differences among species accounted for a greater proportion of variance in the P-max rates and the nitrogen content than the differences among individuals within a species (58.5-78.8% of the total variance for the measured parameters was attributed to species-level differences versus 5.5-17.4% of the variance was attributed to differences between individual trees of a given species). Furthermore, more variation is accounted for by differences among leaves in a single individual tree, than by differences among individual trees of a given species (10.7- 30.4% versus 5.5-17.4%). This result allows us to compare species-level photosynthesis, even if the sample size of the number of trees is low. This is important because studies of canopy-level photosynthesis are often limited by the difficulty of canopy access. As an alternative to direct canopy access measurements of photosynthesis, it would be useful to find an ''easy-to-measure'' proxy for light-saturated photosynthetic rates to facilitate modeling forest carbon cycling. Across all species in this study, the strongest correlation was between nitrogen content expressed on an area basis (mmol m(-2), N- area) and light-saturated P-max rate (mu mol m(-2) s(-1), P- maxarea) (r(2)=0.511). However, within a given species, leaf nitrogen was not tightly correlated with photosynthesis. Our sampling design minimized intra-specific leaf-level variation (i.e., leaves were taken only from the top of the canopy and at only one point in the season). This implies that easy-to- measure trends in nitrogen con tent of leaves may be used to predict the species-specific light-saturated P-max rates},

  Abstract                 = {Human-induced alterations in the birth and mortality rates of species and in the strength of interactions within and between species can lead to changes in the structure and resilience of ecological communities. Recent research points to the importance of considering the distribution of body sizes of species when exploring the response of communities to such perturbations. Here, we present a new size-based approach for assessing the sensitivity and elasticity of community structure (species equilibrium abundances) and resilience (rate of return to equilibrium) to changes in the intrinsic growth rate of species and in the strengths of species interactions. We apply this approach on two natural systems, the pelagic communities of the Baltic Sea and Lake V+¤ttern, to illustrate how it can be used to identify potential keystone species and keystone links. We find that the keystone status of a species is closely linked to its body size. The analysis also suggests that communities are structurally and dynamically more sensitive to changes in the effects of prey on their consumers than in the effects of consumers on their prey. Moreover, we discuss how community sensitivity analysis can be used to study and compare the fragility of communities with different body size distributions by measuring the mean sensitivity or elasticity over all species or all interaction links in a community. We believe that the community sensitivity analysis developed here hol1.20}

Such rampant ecological change and putative ecological instability has not occurred in North American northern boreal zones. This geographical variation in the loss of large carnivores as a consequence of anthropogenic disturbance offers opportunities for examining the potential consequences of extinction on subtle but important ecological patterns involving behaviour and interspecific ecological interactions.

  Abstract                 = {Because most large, terrestrial mammalian predators have already been lost from more than 95-99% of the contiguous United States and Mexico, many ecological communities are either missing dominant selective forces or have new ones dependent upon humans. Such large-scale manipulations of a key element of most ecosystems offer unique opportunities to investigate how the loss of large carnivores affects communities, including the extent, if any, of interactions at different trophic levels. Here, we demonstrate a cascade of ecological events that were triggered by the local extinction of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) from the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. These include (1) the demographic eruption of a large, semi-obligate, riparian- dependent herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), during the past 150 yr; (2) the subsequent alteration of riparian vegetation structure and density by ungulate herbivory; and (3) the coincident reduction of avian neotropical migrants in the impacted willow communities. We contrasted three sites matched hydrologically and ecologically in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA, where grizzly bears and wolves had been eliminated 60-75 yr ago and moose densities were about five times higher, with those on national forest lands outside the park, where predation by the two large carnivores has been replaced by human hunting and moose densities were lower. Avian species richness and nesting density varied inversely with moose abundance, and two riparian specialists, Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and MacGillivray's Warblers (Oporornis tolmiei), were absent from Park riparian systems where moose densities were high. Our findings not only offer empirical support for the top-down effect of large carnivores in terrestrial communities, but also provide a scientific rationale for restoration options to conserve biological diversity. To predict future impacts, whether overt or subtle, of past management, and to restore biodiversity, more must be known about ecological interactions, including the role of large carnivores. Restoration options with respect to the system that we studied in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are simple: (1) do nothing and accept the erosion of biological diversity, (2) replace natural carnivores with human predation, or (3) allow continued dispersal of grizzly bears and wolves into previously occupied, but now vacant, habitat. Although additional science is required to further our understanding of this and other terrestrial systems, a larger conservation challenge remains: to develop public support for ecologically rational conservation options},

  Abstract                 = {Mangrove ecosystems are considered vulnerable to climate change as coastal development limits the ecosystem services and adaptations important to their survival. Although they appear rather simple in terms of species diversity, their ecology is complex due to interacting geophysical forces of tides, surface runoff, river and groundwater discharge, waves, and constituents of sediment, nutrients and saltwater. These interactions limit developing a comprehensive framework for science-based sustainable management practices. A suite of models have been developed independently by various academic and government institutions worldwide to understand the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems and to provide ecological forecasting capabilities under different management scenarios and natural disturbance regimes. The models have progressed from statistical tables representing growth and yield to more sophisticated models describing various system components and processes. Among these models are three individual-based models (IBMs) (FORMAN, KIWI, and MANGRO). A comparison of models' designs reveal differences in the details of process description, particularly, regarding neighbor competition among trees. Each model has thus its specific range of applications. Whereas FORMAN and KIWI are most suitable to address mangrove forest dynamics of stands, MANGRO focuses on landscape dynamics on larger spatial scale. A comparison of the models and a comparison of the models with empirical knowledge further reveal the general needs for further field and validation studies to advance our ecological understanding and management of mangrove wetlands.

However, lack of effect of flooding and reduced soil conditions lead us to reject the second part of hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 was rejected for these three halophytes, as the branch density of 1st- and 2nd-order laterals appears to be controlled by other factors than length of individual laterals. Hypothesis 3 may be true for specific root characteristics (e.g. Length of individual Ist-order laterals), but cannot be generalised (e.g. Branch density and topological index). In conclusion, the present data on root growth in contrasting but homogeneous soil conditions indicate that morphological responsiveness of the root systems of these halophytic grass species is limited, regardless of their location along the elevational gradient}

  Abstract                 = {The nested-subset hypothesis of Patterson and Atmar slates that species composition on islands with less species richness is a proper subset of those on islands with greater species richness. The sum of species absences, referred to as gaps, was suggested as a metric for nestedness, and null models have been used to test whether or not island species exhibited nestedness. Simberloff and Martin stated that finding examples of non-nested faunas was difficult. We revisit previous analyses of nested faunas and introduce a new metric we call ''discrepancy'' which we recommend as a measure for nestedness. We also recommend that the sample spaces conserve both row sums (number of species per site) and column sums (number of sites per species) derived from the incidence matrix. We compare our results to previous analyses},

The formation of aerenchymatous roots and the capacity to elongate shoot parts upon submergence are among the main responses of surviving plants. The role of hormones in the adaptation reaction is emphasized. Owing to high porosities in roots of flood-tolerant plants, radial oxygen loss greatly influences nitrification and denitrification processes in the flooded soil. Nutrient cycles are restored by root-derived oxygen and the oxygenated rhizosphere is detoxified. A new development in flooding ecology is the unravelling of the molecular regulation of hormonally controlled processes. The expression of an ethylene receptor gene in Rumex palustris is highlighted.

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA VR582 Clay RE, Univ S Australia, Fac Engn & Environm, Sch Environm & Recreat Management, Salisbury, SA 5109, AUSTRALIA English Article The ant fauna of Australia's tropical rainforests is composed primarily of Indo-Malayan taxa, and is remarkably disjunct from the surrounding savanna ant fauna, which is dominated by autochthonous, arid-adapted species. Mangrove communities, which like the rainforests have closed canopies, are major components of the Australian tropics; however, their ant faunas remain poorly known, despite ants being the dominant insect group in them. This paper describes the ant fauna of a mangrove community in Darwin Harbour, and compares it with the regional savanna and rainforest fauna. Ants were sampled at baits located on the ground, foliage, and tree trunks, along three transects following the elevation/tidal gradient. Sixteen ant species were recorded in mangroves, including three savanna species, six rainforest species (one, Monomorium ?turneri, not previously recorded in Northern Territory), five habitat generalists, and two species restricted to mangroves, Polyrhachis constricta and P. Sokolova, which remarkably nest in intertidal sediments and are subject to inundation. Species of Crematogaster and Polyrhachis were most abundant, and Polyrhachis was the richest genus with six species. The biogeographical affinities of the ant fauna were very similar to those of local rainforest faunas, but with a higher incidence (50%) of obligately arboreal species. Five of the Polyrhachis species occurred in distinct zones along the elevational/tidal gradient, thus exhibiting the zonation so characteristic of mangrove plant species, although the ant zonation did not appear to be mediated by floristic changes. Potential causes of this zonation are both abiotic and biotic, but their relative importances remain a matter of conjecture},

  Abstract                 = {Population assessment models give managers insight into both the current status of a given population and how that population may respond to management measures. Nearly all of the techniques in both terrestrial and aquatic wildlife management require either an independent estimate of absolute abundance or an index that is consistently proportional to abundance. When neither of these exists, some information can still be mined from the changes in the sex and age ratios within the population over time. When harvesting is highly skewed toward a single sex or age class, the change in these ratios provides information,about the exploitation rate and, when combined with absolute numbers removed, also, provides information on absolute abundance. Traditional change-in-ratio techniques require independent estimates of other variables in order to be used in a predictive sense for open populations. This paper proposes a new method that combines the synthetic approach of fisheries stock assessment with the information contained in sex and age ratios to allow for the assessment of populations when no estimate of absolute abundance or reliable index of abundance exists. Although estimates of population parameters such as survival rates and fecundity are produced, the primary output of the estimation routine is the current population size and structure and the potential population sizes and structures that may result from future management options. The approach is validated using simulated data and is then applied to data for an elk population in north-central Idaho},

However, a similar relationship is absent on a predator-free island in Alaska's Cook Inlet and at two sites in the Jackson Hole region of the Rocky Mountains (USA) where grizzly bears and wolves have been extinct for 50-70 years. While prior study of birds and mammals has demonstrated that prey may retain predator recognition capabilities for thousands of years even after predation as a selective force has been relaxed, the results presented here establish that a desensitization in interspecific responsiveness can also occur in less than ten generations. These results affirm (i) a rapid decoupling in behaviour involving prey and scavengers as a consequence of anthropogenic-caused predator-prey disequilibriums, and (ii) subtle, community-level modifications in terrestrial ecosystems where large carnivores no longer exist. If knowledge about ecological and behavioural processes in extant systems is to be enhanced, the potential effects of recently extinct carnivores must be incorporated into current programmes}ds some promise for identifying species and links that are critical for the structural and dynamic robustness of ecological communities},

All indices showed that complexity was different between quadrats just meters apart in both habitats and was greater in mangrove than in rocky intertidal habitats. Two lines of evidence indicated that variation in complexity affected the density of gastropods in rocky intertidal but not in mangrove habitats. First, the density of gastropods varied 4-fold between quadrats within habitats and, after gastropods were experimentally removed, a similar density and size distribution of gastropods recolonized quadrats in the rocky intertidal. Second, this density was correlated with structural complexity. D was most often correlated with density and thus best represented features of the habitat that affected gastropods. The measurement and effects of structural complexity can be compared between habitats, and these comparisons help elucidate the conditions in which habitat structure may exert strong effects on species}

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA 1. Seed dispersal, germination, and seedling growth characteristics of six helophyte species, Iris pseudacorus, Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, T. latifolia and Scirpus lacustris, were investigated in relation to their water-level zonation. 2. The experiments demonstrated a large variation in these characteristics between the species. 3. Propagule floating capacities range from < 1h (S. lacustris) to > 1000 h (I. pseudacorus). 4. Seed germination in a water-level gradient revealed two groups with respect to germination percentage - exposed soil species (I. pseudacorus, Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis) and submerged soil species (T. angustifolia, T. latifolia). 5. There were two contrasting types of seedling growth response to submergence and exposure: one group of species formed longest leaves under exposed conditions (Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis, I. pseudacorus), and the other under submerged conditions (S. lacustris, T. latifolia, T. angustifolia). 6. The results suggest that early life-history characteristics of the species relate to their locations in the riparian zonation: Phalaris arundinacea and Iris pseudacorus at the higher end, Phragmites australis intermediate, and Typha spp. and Scirpus lacustris at the lower end. Species occurring at lower locations show adaptations to (periodical) flooding of the soil (submersed germination and growth), while those from higher locations require prolonged exposed soil conditions to germinate and to survive the establishment stage Article},

  Abstract                 = {Small-scale vegetational patterns of Georgian lowland and montane forests and wetlands are documented by species per vegetation unit, function of species in particular vegetation units and vegetational sketches. The humid warm- temperate climate of western Georgia contributes to a different spatial pattern than known for most of Europe. One characteristic feature of western Georgian relict vegetation is the co-occurrence of 'Mediterranean', 'Sub- mediterranean', temperate, and Tertiary relict species, as well as of species normally confined to either zonal or atonal vegetation, in the same or closely related vegetation units. The extant distribution of Tertiary relict taxa strongly depends on how they are niching into changing environments. Niching strategies are assumed crucial for extinction or survival in times of rapid climatic/ environmental changes. For Tertiary relict plant taxa in western Georgia we found four different niching strategies which also hold true of other northern hemispheric Tertiary relict plant taxa. Some amphibians and reptiles display similar distribution patterns and niching strategies as do relict plant taxa. A number of relict taxa in the warm humid regions of western Georgia occupy niches in swamp forests which might represent 'primeval' environments of species which are at present also elements of meso-Mediterranean vegetation and of thermophilous forest edges and hedges in Central Europe.

  Abstract                 = {Environmental management decisions are prone to expensive mistakes if they are triggered by hypothesis tests using the conventional Type I error rate (alpha) of 0.05. We derive optimal alpha-levels for decision-making by minimizing a cost function that specifies the overall cost of monitoring and management. When managing an economically valuable koala population, it shows that a decision based on alpha = 0.05 carries an expected cost over $5 million greater than the optimal decision. For a species of such value, there is never any benefit in guarding against the spurious detection of declines and therefore management should proceed directly to recovery action. This result holds in most circumstances where the species' value substantially exceeds its recovery costs. For species of lower economic value, we show that the conventional alpha-level of 0.05 rarely approximates the optimal decision-making threshold. This analysis supports calls for reversing the statistical 'burden of proof' in environmental decision-making when the cost of Type II errors is relatively high},

  Abstract                 = {In light of increasing evidence of declining anuran populations worldwide, an important conservation issue is the extent to which declines are consequences of smaller- scale stresses such as local habitat loss or degradation, or larger-scale stresses such as climate change. Here we show that anuran richness in 77 southeastern Ontario wetlands is negatively correlated with the density of roads on lands within 1 km of the wetland, and positively correlated with the percentage of forest cover. Logistic regression analysis shows that the presence of at least two species, the mink frog (Rana septentrionalis) and the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), is negatively related to road density, while the pickerel frog (Raga palustris) shows significant positive association with adjacent forest cover. These results suggest that in southeastern Ontario, significant conservation gains can be achieved through local land-use planning and management decisions that mitigate the effects of existing roads, minimize the construction of new roads, and discourage further forest conversion on lands adjacent to wetlands},

These have invariably been orientated towards conservation and management goals, and the information used to assess wetland loss or to assign management priorities. Existing national and regional classification systems have not only been useful, but they provide an essential base for developing an international system. At the international level, differences among existing systems in the definition of a wetland and how wetland types are defined assume great importance and need to be resolved. Classification is an essential prerequisite for wetland inventory. A number of international inventories have been undertaken, although these have not generally utilized the available high technology and data storage systems available through remote sensing and geographic information systems. More extensive international inventories will require standardization of techniques for data collection, storage and dissemination. A minimum data set needs to be defined with standards for data accuracy. An international committee under the auspices of an international agency (e.g. IWRB, Ramsar Bureau, IUCN) needs to be established to develop an international classification system and guidelines for carrying out a complete inventory of the world's wetlands Article},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA UU947 Finn M, Georgetown Univ, Dept Biol, Washington,DC 20057 USA English Article Biosphere 2 is a specially constructed, 1.25 ha, greenhouse in southern Arizona, USA that is atmospherically and materially isolated from Biosphere 1, the Earth. Housed inside are living recreations of five natural ecosystems and an agricultural zone. Techniques were developed for the transplantation, maintenance and establishment of a diverse neotropical estuarine ecosystem model (referred to here as the mangrove mesocosm). Technical systems were designed for the simulation and control of environmental conditions including rain (0-3 l s(-1)), wind (0-11 km h(-1)), air (5- 50 degrees C) and water temperature (15-35 degrees C), water circulation (0-20 l s(-1)), salinity (0-45 ppt), relative humidity (10-85% RH) and nutrient removal (up to 20 g-N d(- 1)). In or near the mangrove mesocosm permanent sensors monitored and recorded at 15-min intervals the following ranges: light above (5-35.5 E m(-2) d(-1) and 1600 mu E m(- 2) s(-1) maximum) and below (0.5-5 E m(-2) d(-1)) the mangrove canopy; air(18-42 degrees C) and water(16-27 degrees C) temperature; salinity (25-35 ppt); relative humidity (50-80% RH); pH (7.6-8.1); dissolved oxygen (3.8- 5.5 mg l(-1)); and several biogenic gasses including oxygen (20.5-14.5 ppm), CO, (500-4500 ppm), methane (0- 50 ppm), nitrous oxide (0-80 ppm) and hydrogen sulfide (0-0.1 ppm). From November 1990 to December 1993, mangrove height increased approximately 250% for each of the three mangrove species: Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove). The: spreading mangrove average canopy area increased by 374, 533 and 637% for the red, black and white mangroves, respectively. The mangroves organized into a closed canopy, maturing forest under the unique set of conditions found inside of Biosphere 2. Concurrent litterfall and decomposition monitoring experiments were initiated in October 1992 in the mesocosm and at Florida- based analog research sites. Reproductive litterfall and total litterfall approximated the seasonal patterns found at the field sites. Both total and reproductivelitterfall production in the mesocosm exceeded field levels (except for white mangrove) but fall within reported rates for Southwest Florida. Total litterfall and total reproductive litterfall for the mesocosm red (1281.1 g m(-2) yr(-1); 178.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and black (635.2 g m(-2) yr(-1); 64.6 g m(-2) yr(-1)) mangroves exceed the Florida field site red (948.3 g m(-2) yr(-1); 89.2 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and black (461.7 g m(-2) yr(-1); 16.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) mangrove rates. The field white mangrove total litterfall and total reproductive litterfall (766.3 g m(-2) yr(-1); 215.9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) rates were greater than that produced by the mesocosm white mangroves (654.8 g m(-2) yr(-1); 67.6 g m(-2) yr(-1)). In addition to being a useful system for mangrove ecology, the mesocosm is on display for public education and awareness of the need to conserve wetland areas},

  Abstract                 = {Southwest Florida mangrove forest vegetation was successfully transplanted into a mesocosm within Biosphere 2. Dense stands of mangroves with characteristics comparable to natural Florida mangrove forests developed from the small seedlings and saplings initially installed in the mesocosm. Mangrove overstory was evaluated by leaf area index which ranged from 2.16 to 4.02 m(2)/m(2). Mangrove understory decrease was monitored as the mangrove overstory developed. The Biosphere 2 mesocosm is compared with a similarly planted mesocosm at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. The performance of these mesocosms is used to evaluate existing theories on natural mangrove forest species composition. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved},

Increased appreciation of uses and threats is essential to protect wetlands where justified. Three quarters of India's population is rural, it places great demands on India's wetlands and losses continue to occur. This paper is based on extensive discussions with natural resource managers, government employees, farmers, academicians, and resource users at dozens of sites in India, as well as an extensive literature search. Twelve important kinds of wetland loss are identified and mechanisms believed to be causing them discussed: (1) agricultural conversion, (2) direct deforestation, (3) hydrologic alteration, (4) inundation, (5) defoliation, (6) altered upper watersheds, (7) accumulative water demands, (8) water quality degradation, (9) wetland consolidation, (10) global climate change, (11) ground-water depletion, (12) exotic species and biodiversity. Wetland understanding, management, and public awareness in India must continue growing if wetland resources are to remain functional},

  Abstract                 = {1. The Mediterranean monk seal is an endangered marine mammal with only a few populations thought to be viable. The largest aggregation of this species is found at the Peninsula of Cap Blanc, on the western Sahara, where a colonial structure is maintained. The size of this colony is estimated by annual capture-recapture surveys, but it is unclear if the attained level of precision is enough to detect changes in numbers in the short term.2. In this study, simulated capture-recapture experiments were used to investigate the relationship between population estimates and abundance. The statistical power necessary to detect a population decline with ongoing surveys was estimated, and the requirements for an improvement in precision were evaluated. Additionally, changes in abundance over consecutive surveys were examined for comparison with an alternative method of Bayesian inference.3. Results indicated that the power to detect trends from the actual surveys was lower than should be required for the conservation of a small population, such as the colony at Cap Blanc. A 5% annual rate of decline in abundance would only be detected with high power after 12 years, with a population of 317 seals being reduced to 172. If the annual rate of decline was 10%, 8 years would be required to detect a reduction of 317 to 136 seals.4. Capture-recapture surveys can produce reliable data but do not identify moderate or low population declines. The increase in precision of surveys is costly and time consuming, and other monitoring methods are needed to detect early signs of a decline. Bayesian methods cannot provide a better result because they are not robust to small sample size and heterogeneity in capture probabilities. Despite the need for alternative methods for earlier detection, capture-recapture surveys are still required to estimate the size of the colony, and precision in population estimates can be evaluated in relation to cost effectiveness},

Differences in feeding positions, parasitoid complexes an d parasitization rates of the two dominant insect species in stem s of Rumex crispus were investigated. Apion miniatum (inhabiting the lower 10% of the stem) and Apion violaceum (occurring all alo ng the stem) exploited distinctly different feeding positions, pa rtly due to differences in time of ovipositio.n2. A. Miniatum su ffered less parasitization than A. Violaceum, measured both by nu mber of parasitoid species and parasitization rates. Its feeding position constitutes a refuge.3. Parasitization of A. Violaceum was least in individuals feeding in basal, thick parts of the ste m. There is a trend that the developed refuge increases with incr easing stem diameter.4. The refuge of A. Violaceum in basal posi tions only affected idiobiont ectoparasitoids, because koinobiont endoparasitoids attack the weevils before they enter the stem. M oreover, the koinobiont did benefit from the refuge itself by avo iding hyperparasitism.5. Densities of A. Violaceum increased wit h plant size, whereas percentage parasitism did not differ. Its t hree most abundant parasitoid species showed small-scale density- independent patterns of attack over all plants. Therefore a const ant proportion of weevil larvae mine within the refuge independen t of its potential size.6. Synchronization between weevils and p lants, as well as between parasitoids and hosts, appears to be th e dominant factor for the spatial community structure of the stem borers of Rumex crispus and their enemies},

  Abstract                 = {The article presents new results on the structure and the above-ground biomass of the various population types of mangroves in French Guiana. Nine mangrove stands were studied, each composed of three to ten adjoining plots with areas that varied depending on the density of the populations. Structural parameters and indices were calculated. Individuals representative of the three groups of taxa present were felled: Avicennia germinans (L) Steam, Rhizophora spp., and Laguncularia racemosa (L) Gaertn. The trunks, branches and leaves were sorted and weighed separately. The biomass was obtained by determining the allometric relationships, the general equation selected being of the type y = a(o)x(a1), where the diameter (x) is the predictive variable. The total above-ground biomass varied from 31 t ha(-1) for the pioneer stages to 315 t ha(- 1) for mature coastal mangroves, but with large variations depending on the structural characteristics at each site. The results place the Guianese mangroves among those with high biomass, although lower than those reported for Asia. Based on the relationships between structural parameters and standing biomass, in particular with the use of the ''self- thinning rule'', population dynamics models are proposed},

  Abstract                 = {The mobile mud banks, several kilometres wide and about 30 km long, which form the sedimentary environment of the coast of the Guianas are a consequence of the huge particulate discharge of the Amazon. These mud banks shift towards the northwest, influenced by the combined action of accretion and erosion, a process also affected by periodic variability. Because of this movement, the coastline is unstable and continuously changing. Such changes determine the structure and composition of mangrove forests, the only type of vegetation adapted to this dynamic environment. The objectives of this study were to identify coastal changes that took place over the last 50 years, and to relate them to natural processes of turnover and replenishment of mangrove forests. These objectives have been achieved through a combination of remote sensing techniques (aerial photographs and SPOT satellite images) and field surveys in the area of the Sinnamary Estuary, French Guiana. Ground data were collected in representative mangrove forest stands, chosen as a function of their growth stages and their structural features, from pioneer and young stages to adult, mixed and declining formations. The coastline changes and the mangrove dynamics over the 1951-1999 period are analyzed through production of synthetic digital maps, showing an alternation of net accretion (1951-1966) and erosion periods (1966-1991), followed by the present accretion phase. Based on this structural, functional and historic, information, a global scenario of mangrove forest dynamics is proposed, including a model of forest development, forest gap processes and sedimentological dynamics. The results of this research are discussed within the context of regional (coastal Amazonian area) and global climate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Crabs (Grapsidae, Sesarma) are the dominant macrofaunal group of mangrove forest soils in northern Australia. Little is known about the ecology of these crabs or the factors that influence their distribution in mangrove forests. Pitfall traps were used to sample grapsid crabs in the Murray River estuary in north Queensland. Sampling was conducted at five sites along a salinity gradient from <1 parts-per-thousand at upstream sites to >35 parts-per- thousand at the river mouth. At each site, trapping was done in both low and high intertidal forests. We characterized the sediments at each site by measuring percent sand, silt, clay and organic matter, Eh, pH, and soil pore-water salinity. Four species of grapsids dominated the crab fauna along the Murray River (Sesarma semperi-longicristatum, S. messa, S. brevicristatum, and S. brevipes). Distinct zonation patterns were found along the salinty gradient and between high and low intertidal forests. S. messa was dominant in high intertidal, downstream forests, high and low intertidal forests in the middle to downstream portion of the river, and in low intertidal forests in the central reach of the river. S. brevipes was dominant in both low and high intertidal zone forests at low salinity upstream sites. S. brevicristatum was most abundant in the central reaches of the river and only in the high intertidal zone. S. semperi- longicristatum was found only in the low intertidal zone, downstream forest. Subsequently, tests of salinity tolerances of these crabs were carried out in the laboratory. These indicated very wide tolerances over salinities from completely fresh to hypersaline (60 parts- per-thousand). The osmoregulatory abilities of the crabs were also found to vary. However, neither their salinity tolerance nor osmoregulatory ability adequately explain the zonation patterns we measured in the field. For example, S. brevicristatum had the most restricted distribution, but it had the second broadest salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory ability. Sediment characteristics explained a significant amount of the variation in abundance for two of the crab species. Pore- water salinity provided no explanatory power for any of the species. Individual species abundances are probably influenced by additional factors such as interspecific competition and predation},

  Abstract                 = {Mangrove forests are important coastal wetlands in most of the tropics, but their importance to fisheries is poorly understood. Rationales for conserving these ecosystems are partly based on ideas that mangroves are important to food webs that support fisheries. Here we review use of stable isotopes to test the strength of the mangrove forest-fish connection, suggesting that a dual focus on both food web ecology and habitat use may be most profitable in future studies of this type},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of mangrove diversity and the process of leaf litter decay on the diversity and community structure of meiofauna inhabiting leaf litter were investigated in a simple field experiment in a wet, tropical, soft sediment, mangrove forest in north-eastern Malaysia. Strings of freshly fallen leaves of Rhizophora apiculata and Bruguiera parviflora were placed on the mud surface in two adjacent subplots, each dominated by one of these tree species. The leaf strings were sampled weekly over five weeks and the nematodes and copepods found on the leaves were identified to species and enumerated. It is shown that, under similar conditions of sediment composition, salinity and tidal inundation, the species of mangrove tree or their leaves have little influence on leaf litter meiofaunal climax communities. Such differences as are apparent in the early part of the experiment are probably the result of differences in tree root structure, associated macrofauna and the initial chemical composition of the leaves. It is also shown that there are significant differences in the litter meiofaunal communities during the process of leaf litter decay. For the copepods, a distinct leaf litter community is characterized by the presence of members of the family Darcythompsoniidae and it is the completion of their lifecycle which is the principal feature of the community changes. Development of the nematode community is characterized by subtle shifts in the composition of species inhabiting the leaf litter. It is suggested that changes in the meiofauna community may be more intimately linked to successional changes in the chemistry and/or microflora of the leaf litter than to the physical breakdown of the substratum.

  Comment                  = {AB- Habitat architecture has two major components, size and structural variety. Both these attributes are incorporated in measurements of fractal dimensions which are essentially an expression of habitat size in relation to the scale of measurement. Therefore, the fractal dimensions of a habitat, coupled with energy requirements, may be one explanation for the species abundance/body size distribution of the associated animal assemblages. This concept is tested in the marine environment by an analysis of the fractal dimensions and epifaunal assemblages of four species of macroalgae on the Isles of Scilly. It is shown that the slope of the regression of animal abundance against body size (estimated by sieve mesh size) is related to the fractal dimension of each weed. The application of the energetic equivalence rule, however, overestimates the abundance of smaller animals. In general, smaller animals appear to use proportionately less of the community resources. It is suggested that this is a result of unequal availability of resources due to the different feeding and resource partitioning traits between macrofauna and meiofauna},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence has been accumulating that species pools play a major role in regulating variations in small-scale diversity. However, our ability to unambiguously estimate and interpret species pools remains a major impediment to understanding the processes that control patterns of diversity. Two main approaches have been employed to evaluate the relationships between species pools and species diversity. The direct approach has been to estimate the actual sizes of species pools by sampling discrete areas at larger spatial scales and then relating these estimates to samples taken at smaller scales. The indirect approach has been to search for correlations between abiotic environmental factors and patterns of diversity that are indicative of gradients in species pools. Both of these approaches have substantial predictive capability but also have limitations that impair our ability to draw unambiguous interpretations about causal factors. A primary difficulty for the direct approach is in deciding which species in the larger pool of potential species are actually capable of living in a sample. In this regard, the indirect approach requires fewer assumptions and has the ability to detect previously unsuspected gradients in species pools. As with the direct approach, assessing the causes for observed gradients in species pools remains a limitation for the indirect approach, Consideration of experimental studies of potential niches suggests that it may be valuable to distinguish between potential and observed species pools if the role of competitive exclusion is to be fully assessed. This paper concludes by arguing for (1) an increased use of multivariate studies that examine the effects of species pools indirectly and (2) further experimental studies designed to determine potential species pools},

  Abstract                 = {Considerable debate has developed over the importance of community biomass and species pools in the regulation of community diversity. Attempts to explain patterns of plant diversity as a function of community biomass or productivity have been only partially successful and, in general, have explained only a fraction of the observed variation in diversity. At the same time, studies that have focused on the importance of species pools have led some to conclude that diversity is primarily regulated in the short term by the size of the species pool rather than by biotic interactions. In this paper, I explore how community biomass and species pools may work in combination to regulate diversity in herbaceous plant communities. To address this problem, I employ a simple model in which the dynamics of species richness are a function of aboveground community biomass and environmentally controlled gradients in species pools. Model results lead to two main predictions about the role of biomass regulation: (1) Seasonal dynamics of richness will tend to follow a regular oscillation, with richness rising to peak values during the early to middle portion of the growing season and then declining during the latter part of the season. (2) Seasonal dieback of aboveground tissues facilitates the long-term maintenance of high levels of richness in the community. The persistence of aboveground tissues and accumulation of litter are especially important in limiting the number of species through the suppression of recruitment. Model results also lead to two main predictions about the role of species pools: (1) The height and position of peak richness relative to community biomass will be influenced by the rate at which the species pool increases as available soil resources increase. (2) Variations in nonresource environmental factors (e.g. Soil pH or soil salinity) have the potential to regulate species pools in a way that is uncorrelated with aboveground biomass. Under extreme conditions, such nonresource effects can create a unimodal envelope of biomass-richness values. Available evidence from the literature provides partial support for these predictions, though additional data are needed to provide more convincing tests},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA WK458 Grace JB, US Geol Survey, Natl Wetlands Res Ctr, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette,LA 70506 USA English Article Studies of plant species richness have often emphasized the role of either community biomass (as an indicator of density effects) or abiotic factors. In this article we present a general model that simultaneously examines the relative importance of abiotic and density effects. General and specific models were developed to examine the importance of abiotic conditions, disturbance, and community biomass on plant species richness. Models were evaluated using structural equation modeling based on data from 190 plots across a coastal marsh landscape. The accepted model was found to explain 45% of the observed variation in richness, 75% of biomass, and 65% of light penetration. Model results indicate that abiotic conditions have both direct effects on the species pool and indirect effects on richness mediated through effects on biomass and shading. Effects of disturbance were found to be indirect via biomass. Strong density effects on richness were indicated by the results, and canopy light penetration was found to be a better predictor of richness than was biomass. Overall, it appears that richness in this coastal landscape is controlled in roughly equal proportions by abiotic influences on the species pool and density effects, with disturbance playing a lesser role. The structure of the general model presented should be applicable to a wide variety of herbaceous plant communities},

  Abstract                 = {It has been hypothesized that the high diversity of giant kelp forests is due primarily to the provision of energy and habitat by the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). In this article, I use a 19-year-long kelp forest-monitoring data set from the Channel Islands National Park (a) to identify associations between subtidal species and forested or deforested habitats, (b) to generate an idealized food web for Southern California giant kelp forests in order to identify the primary conduits of energy flow through the system, and (c) to determine changes in the diversity and complexity of this food web due to localized giant kelp deforestation. A total of 275 common species were observed in the park between 1982 and 2000, of which 36% occurred significantly more often in kelp-forested areas than in deforested areas (that is, sea urchin barrens); 25 species were found exclusively in forested areas. Most of these associations were clearly identified as trophic and/or structural associations with giant kelp itself. The producer level of the food web was diverse, although giant kelp apparently represents the greatest single source of fixed carbon through either direct grazing or the production of phytodetritus. Primary, secondary and tertiary consumer levels were also represented by numerous species, and generalist consumers were common. With deforestation, the source of primary production shifts from primarily kelps to ephemeral microalgae, macroalgae, and phytoplankton. These results support the reliance of giant kelp forest food-web structure and diversity on the presence of the forest itself},

  Abstract                 = {Mangrove ecosystems provide valuable ecological services for the maintenance of the adjacent habitats and wildlife preservation. They also provide a highly caloric timber, used frequently for burning purposes as, e.g. Charcoal. The forestry activity usually ignores the capacity of the mangroves to support the local fisheries. Therefore, it is necessary to study the relationship between these activities and how they could be managed in order to maximize their benefits, and at the same time to preserve ecosystem services. This problem was approached by two different modelling procedures, widely used in natural resources management studies: a dynamic optimization and a simulation model. The dynamic optimization model gave us some hints about the best allocation of workers between forestry and fishery sectors. Using the simulation model it was possible to take the data generated and employ it in our first order conditions equations from the optimization model to find the shadow prices for the resources stocks. The most important variable in the simulation is the forest growth rate, since the fishery production is directly dependent on the area of mangrove forest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA XC047 Guerreiro J, Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Lab Maritimo Guia, Estrada Guincho, P-2750 Cascais, PORTUGAL English Article The composition of macroinvertebrate communities in the mangroves of Inhaca island, Mozambique, was analysed. Faunistic samples and sediment cores were collected in order to assess relationships between grain-size distribution, organic matter, phytopigments and the species distribution in two different mangroves: Saco and Ponta Rasa. Results showed the dominance of medium and fine sands rather than colloidal sedimentation, which is originated from the island itself. A clear zonation of benthic organisms is a function of several combined environmental factors which contribute to define mangrove communities. Here they are clearly dominated by polychaeta, in a similar situation as in the SW Madagascar mangroves. Grain-size, together with salinity and ground water were found to be the major factors affecting the macrobenthos distribution. The Saco mangrove constitutes a southern example of a subtropical mangrove with high diversity and production. The Ponta Rasa mangrove may be considered as an atypical one, or an extreme situation to subtropical mangrove, in which diversity is very low and several key-species are lacking. The differences between these two mangroves suggest that microenvironmental conditions, namely water content of sediments and phytobenthos, are determinant to the richness and faunal diversity of these ecosystems},

  Abstract                 = {A major challenge in evaluating patterns of species richness and productivity involves acquiring data to examine these relationships empirically across a range of ecologically significant spatial scales. In this paper, we use data from herb-dominated plant communities at six Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites to examine how the relationship between plant species density and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) differs when the spatial scale of analysis is changed. We quantified this relationship at different spatial scales in which we varied the focus and extent of analysis: (1) among fields within communities, (2) among fields within biomes or biogeographic regions, and (3) among communities within biomes or biogeographic regions. We used species density (D = number of species per m(2)) as our measure of diversity to have a comparable index across all sites and scales. Although we expected unimodal relationships at all spatial scales, we found that spatial scale influenced the form of the relationship. At the scale of fields within different grassland communities, we detected a significant relationship at only one site (Minnesota old-fields), and it was negative linear. When we expanded the extent of analyses to biogeographic regions (grasslands or North America), we found significant unimodal relationships in both cases. However, when we combined data to examine patterns among community types within different biogeographic regions (grassland, alpine tundra, arctic tundra, or North America), we did not detect significant relationships between species density and ANPP for any region. The results of our analyses demonstrate that the spatial scale of analysis - how data are aggregated and patterns examined can influence the form of the relationship between species density and productivity. It also demonstrates the need for data sets from a broad spectrum of sites sampled over a range of scales for examining challenging and controversial ecological hypotheses},

  Comment                  = {AB- The spatial distribution of ciguateric dinoflagellates was investigated in the coral reef lagoon of the island of Mayotte at the end of the dry season of 1992. Both oceanic and lagoonal waters were oligotrophic. Different substrates were investigated (algae, algal turfs and dead corals) in two areas. One area consisted of a transect between an alluvial coastal bay and the outer barrier reef, through lagoonal patch-reefs, and a second area comprised a lagoonal complex. On nearly all the substrates, the dinoflagellates Gambierdiscus toxicus Adachi & Fukuyo, Ostreopsis spp. and Prorocentrum spp., generally exhibited the following relative abundances: Ostreopsis spp. > Prorocentrum spp. > G. toxicus. Highest abundances of all species of dinoflagellates, particularly G. toxicus, occurred on dead corals, more especially on the inner slope of the barrier reef and on lagoonal patch-reefs, but not at the back of the bay nor on the barrier reef outer slope. On macroalgal substrates, dinoflagellates were moderately abundant, but some substrates, such as several red algae, supported higher abundances suggesting a stimulation. Experimental bioassays to compare growth in seawaters previously incubated with macroalgae, showed preconditioned seawaters could be either stimulatory or inhibitory. The red alga, Halymenia floresia (Cryptonemiaceae), inhibited growth of G. toxicus, while Portieria hornemanii stimulated it. Growth was also slightly stimulated by the brown algae Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum cf. turbinatifolium (Sargassaceae). Both red algae stimulated the growth of Ostreopsis ovata to a similar degree},

The variation in annual growth increments of rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) from the Jacks Fork River was significantly correlated over 22 years with the ring width of four tree species: white oak (Quercus alba), post oak (Quercus stellata), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). Rock bass growth and tree growth were both significantly correlated with July rainfall and stream discharge. Variations in annual growth of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) from four streams were significantly correlated over 29 years (1939- 1968) with mean May maximum air temperature but not with tree growth. The magnitude and significance of correlations among growth increments from fish and trees imply that conditions such as topography, stream gradient, organism age, and the distribution of a population relative to its geographic range can influence the climatic response of an organism.

  Abstract                 = {Leaf phenological traits of a sub-tropical Rhizophoracean mangrove, Kandelia candel (L.) Druce, for the period May 1994 to July 1995, are discussed in relation to prevailing environmental factors. Leaf phenologies were characterized by summer leaf production maxima and winter leaf loss maxima. Results of canonical correlation analysis indicate that about 70% of the seasonal variation in leaf production was explained by variation in temperature, humidity and day- length, hence, supporting the hypothesis that leaf phenological traits had a strong environmental component. The strongest single-variable regression model for leaf formation was produced in a temperature model transformed into second order kinetics (r=0.8, p<0.01). This suggests that temperature (or temperature related effects) was the strongest environmental gradient controlling leaf production in K. Candel. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved},

Viable information, especially in developing countries, is often unavailable. Satellite remote sensing is an appropriate and effective data source for mapping the surface of the earth, including a variety of environmental features. Remote-sensing-derived information is enhanced by being one component within a geographic information system (GIS). These techniques were employed to study an expanding delta in East Africa. The Omo River flows from the Ethiopian Highlands into the northern end oi Lake Turkana, creating a large delta extending between Ethiopia and Kenya. This isolated and unique wetland feature has expanded by over 500 sq km in the last 15 years as measured by space-borne remote sensing techniques and corroborated by low-altitude aircraft reconnaissance flights. The growth of the delta appears to be a function of both increased sedimentation and decreased lake levels and river flows. Within the delta there has been a selective decline in wildlife and an increase in human activity, both pastoral and agricultural. The uniqueness of this isolated delta suggests that consideration be given to its possible protection and management},

  Abstract                 = {There is a great lack of proper wastewater treatment in developing countries. With respect to the environment this situation should be changed as fast as possible. Due to the financial situation and to the more stringent standards, wastewater sewerage and treatment are much more developed in industrialized countries. Consequently there is an enormous pool of experience and knowledge in these countries with a lot of different systems based on scientific and practical work. One of the most promising technologies for application in developing countries seems to be constructed wetlands (CW), due to their characteristic properties like utilization of natural processes, simple construction, simple operation and maintenance (O/M), process stability, cost effectiveness, etc. Our institute has been dealing a lot with CW and now feels obliged to transfer its know-how in this field to developing countries to help them in solving their problems. At the moment we are cooperating with the following countries: China, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua, Tanzania and Uganda. Different ways are being followed to realize this together with several organisations and partners. The paper will deal with these cooperative arrangements in detail, demonstrating different projects, describing the procedures in the projects, discussing experiences and last but not least giving recommendations for future optimum ways of proceeding.

  Abstract                 = {Wood density (D-t), an excellent predictor of mechanical properties, is typically viewed in relation to support against gravity, wind, snow, and other environmental forces. In contrast, we show the surprising extent to which variation in D-t and wood structure is linked to support against implosion by negative pressure in the xylem pipeline. The more drought-tolerant the plant, the more negative the xylem pressure can become without cavitation, and the greater the internal load on the xylem conduit walls. Accordingly, D-t was correlated with cavitation resistance. This trend was consistent with the maintenance of a safety factor from implosion by negative pressure: conduit wall span (b) and thickness (t) scaled so that (t/ b)(2) was proportional to cavitation resistance as required to avoid wall collapse. Unexpectedly, trends in D-t may be as much or more related to support of the xylem pipeline as to support of the plant},

They can have strong and direct effects on associated species by creating hospitable environments for organisms lacking the morphological and/or physiological ability to cope without neighbors. Despite the recent recognition of the importance of positive interactions, we know little about how they influence the population dynamics of higher trophic levels. In this study, we have coupled our previous research on positive plant interactions among salt marsh plants with experiments on higher trophic levels to investigate the relative contribution of positive interactions to herbivore and predator population dynamics in a southern New England salt marsh, We experimentally manipulate salt marsh host plants with and without the physical buffering effects of plant neighbors to investigate the colonization dynamics and population growth rates of aphid herbivores, We show that, without plant neighbors, aphid colonization increases on host plants but that negative population growth rates ensure local extinction at all levels of the food chain, Our study demonstrates that positive interactions between neighboring plants can have strong community-wide repercussions and can ultimately determine the integrity of interactions at higher trophic levels},

  Abstract                 = {We experimentally separated the effects of two components of plant diversity-plant species richness and plant functional group richness-on insect communities. Plant species richness and plant functional group richness had contrasting effects on insect abundances, a result we attributed to three factors. First, lower insect abundances at higher plant functional group richness were explained by a sampling effect, which was caused by the increasing likelihood that one low-quality group, C-4 grasses, would be present and reduce average insect abundances by 25%. Second, plant biomass, which was positively related to plant functional group richness, had a strong, positive effect on insect abundances. Third, a positive effect of plant species richness on insect abundances may have been caused by greater availability of alternate plant resources or greater vegetational structure. In addition, a greater diversity of insect species, whose individual abundances were often unaffected by changes in plant species richness, may have generated higher total community abundances. After controlling for the strong, positive influence of insect abundance on insect diversity through rarefaction, insect species richness increased as plant species richness and plant functional group richness increased. Although these variables did not explain a high proportion of variation individually, plant species richness and plant functional group richness had similar effects on insect diversity and opposing effects on insect abundances, and both factors may explain how the loss of plant diversity influences higher trophic levels},

  Abstract                 = {I measured microclimate and photosynthesis of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) saplings in the understory of an old- growth eastern hemlock forest. About 14% of the canopy trees were deciduous. Daily maximum air temperature in the understory was 3-4 degrees C lower than above the canopy in July through September, but only 1-2 degrees C lower from October through June. Photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD) in the understory was typically less than 20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). or about 1% of full sunlight, and exceeded 200 mu mol m(-2) s-(1) during < 1.2% of the daylight hours in July through September. Average PFD was higher in spring, with May having about twice as much total daily PFD as late June and early July. At 22 degrees C, net photosynthesis by hemlock sapling foliage was 0 at approximate to 10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PFD and reached light saturation (approximate to 5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) at approximate to 350 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PFD. Net photosynthesis near light saturation increased slightly as air temperature changed from 11 to 15 degrees C, but did not change significantly between 15 and 30 degrees C. These microclimatic and physiological measurements indicate that net photosynthesis by hemlock saplings is probably little affected by temperature from late spring through early fall. Late spring is probably the time of greatest photosynthesis by eastern hemlock saplings in hemlock forests with deciduous trees in the canopy},

  Abstract                 = {Mangroves are intertidal ecosystems that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. At the low tidal limits of their range, they face swamping by rising sea levels; at the high tidal limits, they face increasing stress from desiccation and high salinity. Facilitation theory may help guide mangrove management and restoration in the face of these threats by suggesting how and when positive intra- and interspecific effects may occur: such effects are predicted in stressed environments such as the intertidal, but have yet to be shown among mangroves. Here, we report the results of a series of experiments at low and high tidal sites examining the effects of mangrove density and species mix on seedling survival and recruitment, and on the ability of mangroves to trap sediment and cause surface elevation change. Increasing density significantly increased the survival of seedlings of two different species at both high and low tidal sites, and enhanced sediment accretion and elevation at the low tidal site. Including Avicennia marina in species mixes enhanced total biomass at a degraded high tidal site. Increasing biomass led to changed microenvironments that allowed the recruitment and survival of different mangrove species, particularly Ceriops tagal},

On the basis of female antennulary segmentation patterns Prionos gen. Nov. Is tentatively assigned to a clade grouping Psammis, Danielssenia and Mucrosenia, yet a full assessment of the phylogenetic relationships will have to await the discovery of the male. The type material of Psammis borealis, formerly placed species incertae sedis in the Paranannopidae, is re-examined. The unique sexual dimorphism has provided supporting evidence for its removal to a new genus Anapophysia together with a second closely related species A. Segonzaci sp. Nov. Described from the deep sea off La Reunion. The detailed armature of the antennary endopod is used to place Bathypsammis, Anapophysia and Fladenia in a lineage leading to the deepwater genera Paranannopus and Cylindronannopus. The possible sistergroup relationship between Bathypsammis and Anapophysia is discussed},

Lignification and/or suberization of the cell wall appeared farther from the root apex.

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the soils and sediments of Cobweb Swamp, adjacent to the archaeological site of Colha in northern Belize, to adumbrate landscape evolution and the impact of the ancient Maya on a tropical palustrine wetland. The Cobweb section exposes a complex and dynamically evolving landscape, with a rich interplay between natural and human forces, The Cobweb depression probably formed as a karstic doline or polje in interbedded limestone and marl of late Tertiary or Pleistocene age, During the latest Pleistocene, a terrestrial marsh covered most of the depression. Slope wash and colluviation from adjacent slopes impacted the depression during the early Holocene, possibly in response to a drier and cooler climate reported to have occurred in the region during this time. After ca, 5600 B.P., the Cobweb depression was affected by relatively rapidly rising sea levels in the area, and a brackish lagoon filled the basin, By 4800 B.P., a peat filled in the lagoon, probably because precipitation of a marl in the lagoon coupled with decreasing rates of sea-level rise enabled emergent vegetation to encroach the shallowing waters. Humans first began to affect the landscape when this peat was at the surface, Massive deforestation, resulting in increased runoff and rising water levels, is the most likely explanation for a fresh-water lagoon that again inundated the Cobweb depression between 3400 and 500 B.P. The Maya Clay was deposited on the edge of this lagoon as the result of upland erosion, almost as soon as deforestation began, but the bulk of the deposit was coincident with the sudden collapse of the Classic Maya civilization ca. 1000 B.P., suggesting that significant environmental degradation was associated with the demise of the Classic Maya, Feat began to fill the Cobweb lagoon sometime before 500 B.P., probably the result of shallower mater levels from decreasing runoff resulting from reforestation after abandonment by the Maya},

The results are as follows: There are 52 species of Mollusca in the areas, and species and abundance distribution increase with salinity. Biomass and density average 7.99 g m(2) and 25 ind, m(2) respectively, with higher values in autumn and winter, and lower in spring and summer. Vertical distribution of biomass is highest in high tide zones and lowest in low tide zones, and density is highest in mid-tide zones and lowest in low tide zones. The relationship between the distribution of Mollusca and the environmental factors are discussed},

  Abstract                 = {A glasshouse experiment was designed to determine whether the terrestrial bladderwort species Utricularia uliginosa Vahl. gained any growth advantage from carnivory at different levels of nitrogen enrichment of the substrate. Three organism treatments were used: a control, a protist-only treatment (Euglena spp.) and a protist + meiofauna treatment (Euglena spp. plus nematodes, copepods, ostracods, cladocerans and Acarina). The organism treatments were factorially combined with three nitrogen levels (N0, N1, N2). Populations of Euglena were successfully established in the substrate of pots in the protist, and meiofauna + protist treatments, and were found in the traps of plants growing in these treatments. Populations of the meiofauna from the inoculating cultures were successfully established in the meiofauna + protist treatment, and were trapped by plants in these treatments. A background contamination of the control and protist-only treatments by Acarina occurred over the course of the experiment; however, numbers of Acarina in these treatments were at least an order of magnitude lower than numbers of meiofauna in the meiofauna + protist treatment. Non-acarinid meiofauna were restricted solely to the meiofauna + protist treatment. Organism treatment interacted significantly with the nitrogen level of the substrate to affect growth of Utricularia. Plants trapping Euglena (+ Acarina) had significantly less dry weight than control plants at the N0 base level of nitrogen; this negative effect of trapping Euglena on plant growth disappeared at the two higher nitrogen levels. The dry weight of plants trapping the full range of meiofauna at the N0 level was comparable with control plants. Plants trapping the full range of meiofauna + Euglena at the N1 level had significantly more dry weight than plants trapping Euglena only, and the highest dry weight of any treatment; the benefit of trapping the full range of meiofauna + Euglena was non-significant at the N2 level. Dry weight of plants was not significantly affected by nitrogen in any organism treatment. These results suggest that carnivory was overcoming a nitrogen deficiency induced by Euglena at the N0 level, but was overcoming deficiencies of other nutrients at the N1 level},

A hitherto unknown species is described herein as Microphilus palmatus n. Sp. The new species is characterized by its urosome much exceeding the cephalosome- metasome in length, the ornamentation of the labrum, the shape of the palp of the first maxilla, the ornamentation of the legs 1-4 and shape of the caudal rami. These and other features of the genus Mychophilus are compared with those from other related genera of the family Ascidicolidae Thorell, 1859},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA The purpose of this essay is to define the role of resource economics in the development of U.S. wetlands policy. I argue that the ''optimal pollution model'' based on maximization of net benefits of wetland protection is, for the most part. not directly applicable to the creation of wetlands policy for two reasons: (1) the delineation of property rights among wetland owners and the general public, as opposed to the maximization of net benefits, is the more fundamental political issue and therefore drives policy-making; (2) the predominant public benefits of wetlands fall into the economic category of ''nonuse values'' which are very difficult to define and measure in a policy-relevant way, and the public's legal rights to them have not been established. These conclusions indicate that resource economics research that focuses upon (1) the economic significance to interested parties of alternative delineations of property rights, (2) development of policy tools appropriate for each possible property rights delineation, and (3) the relative cost-effectiveness of these policy tools is most useful for policy-making},

The present communication is the first report on the use of molecular markers in assessing intra-site and intra-specific polymorphism in one of the mangrove species, Acanthus ilicifolius, for identifying/detecting distinct genotypes for long-term conservation. Random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were used to elucidate the intra- and inter- population variability in this widely distributed mangrove species. In all, 48 genotypes representing eight distinct populations were analysed. A low level of polymorphism was detected at the intra-population level through both RAPD (3.8-7.3%) and RFLP (3.2-9.1%) analyses. At the inter- population level, 25 of the 73 RAPD loci (34%) detected through the use of 13 random primers and 44 of the 96 RFLP loci (45.8%) revealed through 15 probe/enzyme combinations were polymorphic. RFLP analyses were carried out using genomic clones developed from the same species. The somatic cells of the species displayed 48 chromosomes, with no numerical changes at either intra- or inter-population levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Hierarchical competition-colonization models have been used to explain limiting similarities among species, successional dynamics, and species loss under habitat destruction. This class of models assumes that there is an inverse relationship between competitive ability and colonization ability and that competitively superior species exclude competitively inferior species when both occupy the same site. This hierarchical model of performance trade-offs, however, exhibits some unusual behaviors in the high- diversity limit, including infinitesimally close species packing, pathologically slow dynamics, and fundamentally important regularities in trait-abundance relationships. In particular, under the condition of constant mortality across sp

Samples were collected from artificial substrates in Calumet (IL), Hammond (IN), and Michigan City (IN) harbors and represent the first reports of sponges in these waters. Numerical densities for all species combined were as high as 698 sponge colonies/m(2) on the iron hull of the permanently moored 110- m- long ship Milwaukee Clipper in Hammond Harbor. These densities were lowest at 1-m depth and greater at 2- and 3-m depths. A positive correlation (r(2) = 0.74) was found between the density of sponge colonies and the angle of the hull as it changed from near vertical at the water line to overhanging at greater depth (reward the keel). Ephydatia muelleri was the most common species based on frequency of occurrence and percent surface area covet- ed. Observations of epizoic growth of sponges on live zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas) suggest that an ecological interaction exists between these two groups of organisms on these artificial substrates},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution and abundance of macroalgae growing on Avicennia mangrove pneumatophores is described for Woolooware Bay in Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Sampling from a permanent transect was undertaken throughout a 13 month period. The algal species collected included those typical of the 'Bostrychia-Caloglossa Association' with Catenella nipae contributing the greatest biomass. Abundance, measured as dry weight of algae per pneumatophore, was variable with no clear seasonal pattern observed. On the basis of fluctuation in biomass throughout the year a minimum annual productivity of 87.5 g DW m(-2) y(- 1) can be derived. The distribution and abundance of the six epiphytic algae are described in relation to distance from shore. Total biomass was greatest at high levels on the shore though there were differences between species: Catenella nipae, Bostrychia tenella and Bostrychia moritziana were the most abundant algae on the upper shore, Bostrychia tenuissima on the lower shore, with Caloglossa leprieurii present throughout. Algal biomass was independent of the size and density of pneumatophores. Photosynthetically active radiation levels under the canopy were similar across the shore and no correlation was found with algal abundance},

  Abstract                 = {Plant reproduction can be strongly affected by herbivory and different features of pollination ecology, such as pollinator visitation rates and capacity for self-pollination. The purpose of this study is to compare the relative impact of herbivory and pollination on maternal reproductive success in endemic Aquilegia viscosa and its widespread congener Aquilegia vulgaris. We conducted herbivore exclusion experiments in two populations of each species in 2 different years and showed that the maternal fertility of A. viscosa was significantly more limited by floral predation and pre-dispersal seed predation than its widespread congener. In the absence of herbivory, A. viscosa retained significantly lower maternal fertility than A. vulgaris. Experimental pollinations in an insect-free glasshouse showed that the two species have an equal seed/ovule ratio both in the absence of pollinators and in the presence of non-limiting outcross pollination, Pollinator visitation rates were significantly higher in populations of A. vulgaris than in populations of A. viscosa. In addition, path analyses showed that spur length, an important trait for pollinator attraction in Aquilegia, and, indirectly sepal and petal width, contribute positively to the seed/ovule ratio in A. vulgaris, but not in A. viscosa. These results indicate that maternal fertility of endemic A. viscosa is strongly reduced by flower and seed predation despite low rates of pollinator visitation, and that pollen or resource limitation 1 the wild may further reduce maternal fertility. Finally, floral trait variation appears to be decoupled from fertility variation in endemic A. viscosa, which possibly constrains the evolution of reproductive traits in this species},

  Comment                  = {This is a gem of a paper. With elegant, well-explained equations and prose, the authors demonstrate that building more complex models (i.e. with age-structure) will decrease the usefulness of the model when the additional parameters are difficult to estimate. That is, if you can't get the information about a particular parameter (with some certitude), you might as well leave it out of the model. When the new terms have to be guesstimated, the magnitude of the error terms in the predictions (the level of uncertainty) increases dramatically. The main message is model what you've got, not what you'd like to have.},

  Abstract                 = {Global extinction of a species is sadly irreversible. At a local scale, however, extinctions may be followed by re- invasion. We here show that this is not necessarily the case and that an ecological community may close its doors for re- invasion of species lost from it. Previous studies of how communities are assembled have shown that there may be rules for that process and that limitations are set to the order by which species are introduced and put together. Instead of focusing on the assembly process we randomly generated simple competitive model communities that were stable and allowed for two to 10 coexisting species. When a randomly selected single species was removed from the community, the cascading species loss was recorded and frequently the resulting community was more than halved. Cascading extinctions have previously been recorded, but we here show that the relative magnitude of the cascade is dependent on community size land not only trophic structure) and that the reintroduction of the original species lost often is impossible. Hence, species loss does not simply leave a void potentially refilled, bur: permanently alters the entire community structure and consequently the adaptive landscape for potential re-invaders},

  Abstract                 = {Ecosystem dynamics and the responses to climate change in mangrove forests are poorly understood. We applied the biogeochemical process model Biome-BGC to simulate the dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP) and leaf area index (LAI) under the present and future climate conditions in mangrove forests in Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, and Qiongshan across the southern coast of China, and in three monocultural mangrove stands of two native species, Avicennia marina and Kandelia obovata, and one exotic species, Sonneratia apetala, in Shenzhen. The soil hydrological process of the model was modified by incorporating a soil water (SW) stress index to account for the impact of the effective SW availability in the coastal wetland. Our modified Biome-BGC well predicted the dynamics of NPP and LAI in the mangrove forests at the study sites. We found that the six mangrove systems differed in sensitivity to variations in the effective SW availability. At the ecosystem level, however, soil salinity alone could not entirely explain the limitation of the effective SW availability on the productivity of mangrove forests. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration differentially affected growth of different mangrove species but only had a small impact on NPP (< 7%); whereas a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration associated with a 2A degrees C temperature rise would increase NPP by 14-19% across the three geographically separate mangrove forests and by 12% to as much as 68% across the three monocultural mangrove stands. Our simulation analysis indicates that temperature change is more important than increasing CO2 concentration in affecting productivity of mangroves at the ecosystem level, and that different mangrove species differ in sensitivity to increases in temperature and CO2 concentration},

  Abstract                 = {Animals often select one item from a set of candidates, as when choosing a foraging site or mate, and are expected to possess accurate and efficient rules for acquiring information and making decisions. Little is known, however, about the decision rules animals use. We compare patterns of information sampling by western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) when choosing a nut with three decision rules: best of n (BN), flexible threshold (FT), and comparative Bayes (CB). First, we use a null hypothesis testing approach and find that the CB decision rule, in which individuals use past experiences to make nonrandom assessment and choice decisions, produces patterns of behavior that more closely correspond to observed patterns of nut sampling in scrub-jays than the other two rules. This approach does not allow us to quantify how much better CB is at predicting scrub-jay behavior than the other decision rules. second, we use a model selection approach that uses Akaike information Criteria to quantify how well alternative models approximate observed data. We find that the CB rule is much more likely to produce the observed patterns of scrub-jay behavior than the other rules. This result provides some of the best empirical evidence of the use of Bayesian information updating by a nonhuman animal},

  Abstract                 = {To begin identifying what behavioral details might be needed to characterize community dynamics and stability, we examined the effect of prey behavioral responses to predation risk on community dynamics and stability. We considered the case of prey altering their foraging effort to trade off energy gain and predation risk. We used state-dependent dynamic optimization to calculate the optimal trade-off for four models of prey behaviorally responding to predation risk. We consider a fixed behavior model in which prey use constant levels of foraging effort and three flexible behavior models in which prey change their foraging effort according to their physiological state and their perceived level of predation risk. Flexible behavior was destabilizing at the community level as evidenced by higher predator-prey oscillations and lower community persistence times. The mechanisms by which prey estimated predation risk also affected community stability. We found that community dynamics resulting from prey with flexible behavior and fixed perception of risk approximated community dynamics resulting from prey with flexible behavior and perfect information about predation risk, however neither approximated the community dynamics resulting from prey with flexible behavior and flexible perception of risk. Thus, whether it might be possible to abstract complex behavior with simpler rules when modeling community dynamics depends on the prey's behavioral mechanisms, which are empirically poorly known},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA A study of the mangrove fish fauna in a bay of Martinique Island (French West Indies) was carried out at different seasons during two consecutive years. Fishes were sampled with specific hoop- nets in the coastal areas at and stations. A total of 87 species was collected in the bay. Most individuals were represented by small-size specimens and juveniles. The overall species richness varied according to the stations and the sampling periods. The biomass and number of individuals were variable according to the location but remained stable in time. A factor correspondence analysis and a hierarchical clustering with median links were used to follow the evolution of the stations in space and time. Two types of stations were differentiated: the stations characterized by the mangrove and those under the influence of seagrass beds. A seasonal cycle, opposing the dry periods to the others, was observed. Thus, it seems that the use of the mangrove habitat by the fishes is optimized through a complete reorganization of communities in terms of species composition whereas the overall number and biomass remain stable. This model remains valid even for the most constraining biota of the mangrove ecosystem inhabited by a small number of well adapted species},

  Abstract                 = {Isoetids are small, submerged vascular plants that often dominate the vegetation of soft-water lakes. The isoetids have short stiff leaves and large roots that might make up more than 50% of plant biomass. Leaves and roots have a system of internal gas spaces that allow efficient intra-plant gas transport and are the morphological basis for the remarkable use of sediment CO2 in photosynthesis by isoetids. This ability allows the plants to exploit the rich CO2 pool in the sediment of soft-water lakes and thereby partly ameliorate the low CO2 availability in the bulk water. The transport Of CO2 from roots to leaves is by diffusion in the lacunae. Diffusion is relatively slow over longer distances and appears to set an upper limit to the leaf-length of isoetids. Quantitatively, the use of sediment CO2 accounts for most of the inorganic carbon assimilated by isoetids and only at very high CO2 concentrations in the bulk water significant amounts are taken up through the leaf surface. Physiologically some of the isoetids are unique among submerged macrophytes by featuring the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM).,CAM in isoetids is considered a carbon conserving mechanism and is an ecological advantage in typical isoetid habitats. CAM allows the plants to take up CO2 from the water at night when competition from other plants is eliminated and, since daytime CO2 uptake is unaffected by CAM, the time-slot during which CAM-isoetids can assimilate inorganic carbon is expanded compared to non-CAM species. The unique morphological and physiological traits and adaptations of isoetids allow them to prosper under the conditions prevailing in soft-water lakes. Still, growth is restrained by low resource availability and by an inherent low capacity for growth. Isoetids grow throughout the year with higher rates in summer and lower in winter. Annual leaf turnover rates are low and correspond to a leaf lifetime as long as 700 days in som2  (Salicaceae) from the middle Eocene Green River formation, northeastern Utah},

  Abstract                 = {Illegal harvesting is a serious threat to the persistence of many plant and animal taxa. The combination of highly polymorphic DNA markers and new statistical methods called "assignment tests" can potentially help detect and thereby reduce poaching. Assignment tests can identify the population of origin of individuals if populations are genetically differentiated. We evaluated the usefulness of two assignment tests to wildlife forensics by applying them to large empirical (microsatellite DNA) data sets from 10 species. We also conducted computer simulations to assess the influence of genetic polymorphism ( heterozygosity) and population differentiation (F-ST) on the performance of the tests. The fully Bayesian assignment test of Pritchard et al. (2000) performed better than the partially Bayesian exclusion test of Cornuet et al. (1999), but the fully Bayesian method requires the assumption that the true population of origin was sampled. The median percentage of individuals correctly assigned for the 10 empirical data sets was 61% and 36% for the assignment and exclusion tests, respectively. Both the empirical and simulated data sets suggest that nearly all individuals can be assigned with high statistical certainty (99.9%) for two highly differentiated populations ( F (ST) approximate to 0.15-0.2) when 10 loci (H > 0.6) and samples of 30-50 individuals are used per population. We recommend using both tests when the true population of origin might not have been sampled in the data set},

Marcetia shepherdii, collected in Marau, at sea level, and M. Lychnophoroides, from Chapada Diamantina, are both endemic to Bahia. The new species il Marcetia shepherdii and M. Lychnophoroides, together with ill. Luetzelburgii Markgraf, constitute a group of closely related species. They share in common subcoriaceous, fleshy, imbricate to subimbricate, revolute leaves. Marcetia shepherdii is distinguished by its rigid, erect branchlets, yellowish green leaves that are glabrous on the adaxial surface, unappendaged and broadly dilated connectives, linear-oblong thecae with a ventrally inclined pore, and a unique 2-locular ovary, Marcetia lychnophoroides has velutinous to sublanate branchlets, cinereous-green leaves that are densely puberulous-sericeous on the abaxial surface, unprolonged and inconspicuously bilobulate connectives, and a 3- or 4-locular ovary. Marcetia semiriana is very similar to M. Taxifolia (A. Saint-Hilaire) DC., differing in the prostrate branches, long pedunculate flowers, and straight anthers},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA WM921 Martins EP, Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Eugene,OR 97403 USA English Article This article considers the statistical issues relevant to the comparative method in evolutionary biology. A generalized Linear model (GLM) is presented for the analysis of comparative data, which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship between traits or between traits and environments, the rate of phenotypic evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative studies. We then discuss ways of specifying the sources of error involved in a comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the impact of these sources of error can be taken into account in a comparative analysis. In contrast to most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our procedure offers substantial flexibility in the choice of microevolutionary assumptions underlying the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to choose assumptions thattate'') characters in the same analysis},

Overgrowth relationships of encrusting marine orga nisms constitute an exception but have previously been reported i n only temporally and geographically local occurrences. Results o f overgrowths between members of two bryozoan clades, the Cyclost omata and the Cheilostomata, have been compiled for faunas distri buted through the past 100 Myr. The cheilostomes have consistentl y out-competed the cyclostomes, with approximately 66% overgrowth success through the entire interval. This difference in success in direct interactions along with the Mid-Cretaceous rapid radiat ion of cheilostomes is interpreted as a factor in the Mid- to Lat e Cretaceous reversal from the previous diversification to stasis or gradual decline of cyclostome diversity},

Ecological studies on this family have focused on geographical areas where the taxonomy is clear at species level. In some areas, notably the North Atlantic, this happy state does not exist and there has been extensive taxonomic confusion. As a result, considerable effort has gone into the study of the evolutionary biology of the littorinids over the last 20 years. Many of these studies have been aimed at understanding the taxonomic status of species. I have not addressed these.     ë 13: analysis of mutants with a wide range of lethal phases},

For sampling, 13 gill nets of mesh size 12 - 70 mm (non- stretched) were laid along the mangrove's shoreline. It was found that nocturnal captures were higher than diurnal, not only in number of species, but in values of diversity and equitability. At the same time, an inventory of the ichthyofauna present under the mangrove was accomplished, using sub-aquatic transects. The data obtained were similar to that of diurnal species captured in gill nets. From these results we infer that the change in composition of nocturnal captures with gal nets shows the re- distribution of the species in the mangrove caused by changes in illumination levels. This factor is rarely taken into account when studies of the community structure are based only on diurnal sub-aquatic inventories Article},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Sixty-two barrier islands on the Pacific Coast of Colombia are reported and described. The islands, covered by tropical rainforest and backed by mangrove forests, line the seaward margin of a narrow, extensive, deltaic plain formed from rivers draining the northwestern Andes. The islands are of interest because of a combination of factors including: their position on a leading-edge coast which contributes to relative sea-level rise through long- term subsidence; short-term seismic subsidence and tsunamis; their tropical setting where deltaic sedimentation and heavy vegetative cover influence island dynamics in terms of subsidence, river channel switching and quality and quantity of sand supply, the possible shortterm influence of El Nino events; and the lack of human influence on island dynamics. Five genetic island groups are identified: two groups associated with straight stretches of coastal lowland and three delta lobe groups (Rio San Juan, Rio Patia, and Rio Mira deltas). A few of the islands formed due to spit detachment. initially the islands were probably transgressive, then became regressive for an indeterminate period before recent reinitiation of a transgressive phase, and severe island front erosion. Many of the islands are sand starved due to sediment supply loss when distributary switching occurred, or because they are in areas with little sand in the associated mangrove substrate and no fluvial sand supply. The recognition of the barrier island nature of this coast provides a new management tool to guide coastal hazard mitigation and future development. Future stratigraphic studies may provide a basis to identify the frequency of shortterm events such as Fl Nino and tsunamis and to establish recent sea level history for specific island groups},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA For over a decade, ecologists have repeatedly asserted that community food webs possess fundamental properties that are roughly constant among webs with widely varying numbers of species. This assertion of ''scale invariance'' is reevaluated here among 60 food webs originally published in its support. This analysis contradicts the conventional view of scale invariance by demonstrating highly significant trends in six of eight properties investigated. As the size of food webs increases to 54 trophic species, the fraction of intermediate species, the links/species ratio, and the fraction of links between intermediate species also increase. Concurrently, the fractions of top species, basal species, and links between top and basal species decrease. Only one of these properties, the links/species ratio, is widely thought not to be scale invariant. These trends corroborate hypotheses of scale-dependent food-web structure that successfully predict properties of new, high-quality food webs containing many more than 54 species. This success suggests that general, quantitative, and successfully predictive constraints in fundamental aspects of ecological organization have been discovered. Such discoveries are particularly important, because the lack of general prediction among all terrestrial and aquatic systems seriously impedes the maturation of ecology as a scientific discipline},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA A central question in food-web research focuses on the relation between species at different trophic levels and ''scale'' or, in more specific terms, the number of species in food webs. We show that recently advanced scale- dependence hypotheses are consistent with independent data and assumptions connecting properties of the smallest food webs with those of the largest. Consistent with scale dependence, these data and assumptions suggest that mean chain length and the fractions of species at top, intermediate, and basal trophic levels depend on the number of species within ''local'' (i.e., small-scaled) webs with 2 to 10(2) species. Our analysis also suggests that the fractions of species in different trophic levels become asymptotically stable for regionally to globally scaled food webs with 10(4) to 10(7) species, respectively. A new hypothesis for the behavior of mean chain length in regional to global webs is also advanced. Our analyses specify for the first time specific functional forms for the effects of scare on food-web structure that take into account recently demonstrated scale dependencies at the local scale as well as estimates of biodiversity at regional and global scales. Rates of change over specific ranges are described as well as numerical estimates of asymptotes},

For sampling, 13 gill nets of mesh size 12 - 70 mm (non- stretched) were laid along the mangrove's shoreline. It was found that nocturnal captures were higher than diurnal, not only in number of species, but in values of diversity and equitability. At the same time, an inventory of the ichthyofauna present under the mangrove was accomplished, using sub-aquatic transects. The data obtained were similar to that of diurnal species captured in gill nets. From these results we infer that the change in composition of nocturnal captures with gal nets shows the re- distribution of the species in the mangrove caused by changes in illumination levels. This factor is rarely taken into account when studies of the community structure are based only on diurnal sub-aquatic inventories Article},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Sixty-two barrier islands on the Pacific Coast of Colombia are reported and described. The islands, covered by tropical rainforest and backed by mangrove forests, line the seaward margin of a narrow, extensive, deltaic plain formed from rivers draining the northwestern Andes. The islands are of interest because of a combination of factors including: their position on a leading-edge coast which contributes to relative sea-level rise through long- term subsidence; short-term seismic subsidence and tsunamis; their tropical setting where deltaic sedimentation and heavy vegetative cover influence island dynamics in terms of subsidence, river channel switching and quality and quantity of sand supply, the possible shortterm influence of El Nino events; and the lack of human influence on island dynamics. Five genetic island groups are identified: two groups associated with straight stretches of coastal lowland and three delta lobe groups (Rio San Juan, Rio Patia, and Rio Mira deltas). A few of the islands formed due to spit detachment. initially the islands were probably transgressive, then became regressive for an indeterminate period before recent reinitiation of a transgressive phase, and severe island front erosion. Many of the islands are sand starved due to sediment supply loss when distributary switching occurred, or because they are in areas with little sand in the associated mangrove substrate and no fluvial sand supply. The recognition of the barrier island nature of this coast provides a new management tool to guide coastal hazard mitigation and future development. Future stratigraphic studies may provide a basis to identify the frequency of shortterm events such as Fl Nino and tsunamis and to establish recent sea level history for specific island groups},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA For over a decade, ecologists have repeatedly asserted that community food webs possess fundamental properties that are roughly constant among webs with widely varying numbers of species. This assertion of ''scale invariance'' is reevaluated here among 60 food webs originally published in its support. This analysis contradicts the conventional view of scale invariance by demonstrating highly significant trends in six of eight properties investigated. As the size of food webs increases to 54 trophic species, the fraction of intermediate species, the links/species ratio, and the fraction of links between intermediate species also increase. Concurrently, the fractions of top species, basal species, and links between top and basal species decrease. Only one of these properties, the links/species ratio, is widely thought not to be scale invariant. These trends corroborate hypotheses of scale-dependent food-web structure that successfully predict properties of new, high-quality food webs containing many more than 54 species. This success suggests that general, quantitative, and successfully predictive constraints in fundamental aspects of ecological organization have been discovered. Such discoveries are particularly important, because the lack of general prediction among all terrestrial and aquatic systems seriously impedes the maturation of ecology as a scientific discipline},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA A central question in food-web research focuses on the relation between species at different trophic levels and ''scale'' or, in more specific terms, the number of species in food webs. We show that recently advanced scale- dependence hypotheses are consistent with independent data and assumptions connecting properties of the smallest food webs with those of the largest. Consistent with scale dependence, these data and assumptions suggest that mean chain length and the fractions of species at top, intermediate, and basal trophic levels depend on the number of species within ''local'' (i.e., small-scaled) webs with 2 to 10(2) species. Our analysis also suggests that the fractions of species in different trophic levels become asymptotically stable for regionally to globally scaled food webs with 10(4) to 10(7) species, respectively. A new hypothesis for the behavior of mean chain length in regional to global webs is also advanced. Our analyses specify for the first time specific functional forms for the effects of scare on food-web structure that take into account recently demonstrated scale dependencies at the local scale as well as estimates of biodiversity at regional and global scales. Rates of change over specific ranges are described as well as numerical estimates of asymptotes},

Halocnemum strobilaceum and Anhrocnemum glaucum native to the Mediterranean salt marshes. Plant material were collected at a distance of 1, 3 and 5 km from an early constructed cement factory in the area. Washed cements from the surface area of study plants were found to be about 5.0, 1.7 and 1.0 mu g cm(-2) at the three locations respectively. Cement increased the mortality of young branches leading to a reduction in the height and cover of the three species, especially Arthrocnemum glaucum, which was most sensitive to the dust. Water content, relative water content and succulence were improved in the living parts of the three species. A considerable increase in proline was found in Anhrocnemum glaucum and in soluble carbohydrate for the other two species},

  Abstract                 = {A study of beach erosion and sea encroachment in the rural South Pacific was undertaken. Two islands of Fiji were chosen as study areas. On the basis of observation and interviews with elderly inhabitants of long-established coastal settlements, the coastal problems and countermeasures which they applied traditionally and recently were evaluated. Beach erosion in most of Fiji became significant only some 40 years ago. The causes of this change are considered to be a combination of human-induced development and global sea-level rise. Though people tried to respond to it mainly by building seawalls, there are many inappropriate elements in design and materials. Suggestions are made to improve coastal protection and to address the threats of predicted future accelerated sea-level rise and climate change},

Effects of NaCl on growth and ion content of each callus were measured. The growth rate of calluses derived from leaves (leaf callus) gradually decreased as the NaCl concentration in the medium increased, while that of calluses derived from seedlings (seedling callus) was highest in the medium containing 100 mM NaCl. Concentrations of Na and Cl in both calluses increased with increasing the NaCl concentration in the culture medium. The concentration of K of leaf calluses greatly decreased at 300 mM NaCl, while the K concentration of seedling calluses decreased only slightly and remained relatively high even in the presence of 300 mM NaCl. Transient treatment of leaf calluses with media containing high concentrations of NaCl frequently induced regeneration of adventitious tissues},

Using aerial photographs and a GIS, we examined changes in the Rawhide Wildlife Management Area in southeastern Wyoming between 1937 and 1990 after shifts in the frequency and intensity of flooding of the North Platte River. The river declined in wetted area by 75% between 1937 and 1990. Also, the areal proportion occupied by cottonwood (Populus spp.) stands with <30% canopy closure increased while stands with >70% canopy closure decreased during this period, indicating a shift from young, dense stands to older, more open stands. Some traditional measures of landscape structure (i.e. richness, diversity, dominance, average patch perimeter length, average patch shape), however, appeared insensitive to these changes. Finally, the proportion of the landscape that changed land types declined with increasing distance from the river. We expect further modification of the landscape structure, associated with continued declines in cottonwood recruitment and increases in cottonwood mortality},

  Abstract                 = {The food habits of wading birds in the tropics are poorly known, particularly in coastal systems. We documented the food habits of Tricolored Herons (Egretta tricolor), Great Egrets (Ardea alba), Snowy Egrets (E. Thula) and Little Blue Herons (E. Caerulea), and assessed the degree of similarity among their diets in a mangrove swamp in southwestern Puerto Rico. Thirty-five birds were collected during the winters of 1994 and 1995 to examine their stomach contents. Eleven prey groups, comprised of 7 families of fish, 2 genera of crustacea (Xiphocaris, Uca) a lizard (Anolis spp.) and one group of insecta (i.e., Orthoptera), were identified. Great and Snowy Egrets fed mainly on shrimps (Xiphocaris spp.) and guppies (Poecilia spp.),while Little Blue Herons fed exclusively on Fiddler crabs (Uca spp.), and Tricolored Herons fed mainly on guppies (Poecilia spp.) and snooks (Centropomus spp.). Three dietary groups were identified on the basis of a percentage overlap index. Snowy and Great Egrets exhibited the highest degree of dietary overlap (54%) owing to their high consumption of shrimps. Fish contributed to the intermediate overlap values (22-24%) among Tricolored Herons and Snowy and Great Egrets. Little Blue Herons overlapped the least (i.e., < 1%) with Tricolored Herons and Great Egrets, and not at all with Snowy Egrets. Our data underscored the ability of wading birds to prey upon a variety of resources across their range. This capability is advantageous when exploiting coastal systems which might exhibit spatio-temporal fluctuations in prey availability},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change is being experienced intensely in the mangrove dominated deltaic complex of Indian Sundarbans. Deglaciation of Gangotri glacier in the Himalayan range and several anthropogenic influences has accelerated the phenomenon since last two decades. Four indicators (surface water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and transparency) considered in the present study exhibited significant correlations with global warming and caused considerable alteration of hydrological parameters over a period of 27 years. Owing to varied geographical features in the western and eastern sectors of the deltaic complex, the foot prints of climate change were perceived in different pattern and scale. The surface water temperature showed increasing trend in both sectors (6.14% and 6.12% rise in western and eastern sectors respectively). The transparency reduced by 25% in both western and eastern sectors. This may be the effect of increased erosion, anthropogenic activities and silt contribution by the River Ganges. The salinity and dissolved oxygen exhibited contradictory trends in the western and eastern sectors, which may be attributed to deglaciation process in the Himalayan range. The blockage of the major rivers in the eastern Indian Sundarbans by heavy silt and solid wastes from the adjacent city of Kolkata posed serious problems to the island dwellers by way of increasing salinity and decreased dissolved oxygen. Documentation of stenohaline phytoplankton species in upstream regions of eastern Indian Sundarbans (secondary source) confirmed the intrusion of sea water from Bay of Bengal. Such intrusion has serious adverse effect on the livelihood of the local people},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA WP589 Mogi M, Saga Med Sch, Dept Microbiol, Div Parasitol, Nabeshima 5- 1-1, Saga 849, JAPAN English Article Variation in 14 aquatic communities of dipterans in pitchers of 3 Nepenthes species was studied in Singapore. Communities in 3 clumps of Nepenthes ampullaria Jack included 3 large aquatic predators, Toxorhynchites acaudatus (Leicester), Nepenthosyrphus sp., and Nepenthomyia sp. In communities in 2 clumps of Nepenthes rafflesiana Jack, another large aquatic predator, Pierretia sp., occurred at low rates; but the remaining 9 communities (3 N. Ampullaria, 2 N. Rafflesiana, and 4 N. Gracilis Korth. Clumps) lacked large aquatic predators. In 3 N. Ampullaria communities with large aquatic predators, phorid density was low and 4-5 filter- feeder mosquito species coexisted. There, filter feeder communities were dominated by Triptervides nepenthis (Edwards) and Uranotaenia moultoni Edwards; Tripteroides tenax (Meijere) and Culex eminentia (Leicester) together occupied <10%. In contrast, 11 other filter feeder communities were monopolized by T. Tenax (3 communities), inhabited only by T. Tenax and C. Eminentia (3 communities), or T. Tenax or C. Eminentia (or both), occupied >88% of 2-3 species (5 communities). Unique prey community structure in N. Ampullaria clumps with large aquatic predators was attributed at least partly to selective removal of superior competitors by the predators and resultant colonization of inferior competitors more resistant to predation},

  Abstract                 = {The Godavari estuarine system extending over approximately 316 km(2) has significant annual variation of salinity due to seasonal flooding which is mainly monsoon fed. This area has dense vegetation of mangroves and is characterised by predominance of Avicennia sp. Excoecaria agallocha and Rhizophora sp. In the coastal waters adjacent to the mangroves three economically important species of prawns occur (Penaeus monadon, P. Indicus and Metapenaeus monoceras). Their larvae migrate and dwell in the mangrove environment. By analysis for the natural stable carbon isotope ratios, it was possible to establish the primary carbon source from the mangroves to that of larvae and juveniles of P. Indicus and P. Monodon. This information can be used to exploit the mangrove habitat as prawn nurseries},

Among the eight commercially important species recorded, Penaeus indicus H. Milne Edwards, P. merguiensis De Man, P. monodon Fabricus and Metapenaeus dobsoni (Miers) were predominant. The postlarval recruitment size varied with species: P. indicus and P. merguiensis recruited at the size of 9-11 mm total length (TL), P. monodon at 12-14 mm TL and M. dobsoni at 4-6 mm TL. The species P. indicus, P. merguiensis and M. dobsoni were observed continuously throughout the study period with maximum abundance occurring from July to September in 1984- 85 and from August through October in 1985-86. P. monodon occurred seasonally from November to January in both years. Postlarvae and juvenile catches were low during low salinity and high salinity periods and a higher density was observed in the months of moderate water salinity. Large numbers of P. indicus, P. merguiensis and M. dobsoni clearly showed the preference to the detritus rich muddy substrate, whereas P. monodon did not show any preference and was equally abundant over different substrate types},

  Abstract                 = {A methanogenic bacterium was enriched with trimethylamine and isolated from mangrove sediments. The isolate was a non- spore-forming regular to slightly irregular coccus (0.4-1 mm in diameter). The isolate required sodium chloride for growth with maximal methanogenesis at 420 mM NaCl at 30 degrees C. The optimal growth temperature was 30-35 degrees C with maximal methane production at 30 degrees C. The maximum growth rate was between pH 6.6 and 7.2 with maximum methane production at pH 6.8. The growth requirement of sulfide was 10-15 mM with maximum methane production at 10 mM at 30 degrees C. Mono-, di-, and trimethylamine or methanol were substrates for the methanogen; sodium acetate and H-2:CO2 were not. The DNA base content is consistent with the type descriptions of Methanoccoides methylutens, a methylotrophic methanogen isolated from submarine sediments. The isolate was found to utilize methylamines that are found in mangroves without having to compete with sulfate-reducing bacteria for H-2.},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA A survey of the intertidal polychaete fauna of the Jaltepeque estuary, Pacific coast of El Salvador (13 degrees N - 89 degrees W), was conducted during December of 1990 (dry season) and July of 1991 (rainy season). A total of 15 stations were sampled along the estuary, and 15 core samples (core area: 17.7 cm(2)) collected at each one, to a depth of 15 cm into the sediment. Samples were preserved in 10% formalin in sea water stained with Pose Bengal. A 500 micron mesh sieve was used to separate the organisms from the sediments. A total of 450 core samples yielded 5315 polychaetes distributed among 30 species. Densities ranged between 111 and 22 296 per m(2), with a mean of about 6 500. The salinity gradient along the axis of the estuary ranged between 14 and 30 parts per thousand during the rainy season, and from 22 to 30 parts per thousand during the dry season. This gradient is smaller than that observed (0 to 31 parts per thousand) in a polychaete survey conducted over, a one year period, at the site in the late 1950's. A comparison of the polychaete species found in both studies only yielded 28% similarity (Sorensen's index), even though samples were collected at nearly the same stations. Although the durations of both studies differ considerably, we expected to find more species in common. The total number of species collected in both studies was, however, very similar (30 and 36). Data presented in this paper provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the polychaete fauna in the Jaltepeque estuary is presently composed of more eurihaline species than in the past. The Jaltepeque estuary region has undergone considerable development over recent decades, but a direct impact on its benthic fauna is difficult to assess. That this fauna was studied in the late 1950's as well as in this paper, provides a unique reference framework, very rare in benthic tropical research, for future more complex surveys Article},

However, there is no detail data for mechanism of salt resistance in Salicornia plants. In the present work, changes in growth, pH and osmotic pressure were investigated at the organ level durins at the organ level during the growth period of wild Salicornia plants. Further, glycinebetaine in the plants at the end of growth stage was determined. Plants of Salicornia around Lake Notoro-ko in the eastern region of Hokkaido, Japan germinated in the ground at the end of March, The fresh weight and the length of the aerial and root portions of the plants increased most between the end of May and the end of August. The plants bloomed at the end of July, and plants gradually changed color from green to red after the end of August. The pH in stems and branches of the plants increased from pH 7.6 to pH 8.8 during the growth period. Also, osmotic pressure in stems and branches of the plants increased remarkably from about 650 mOsm . Kg(-1) to 2,600 mOsm . Kg(-1) throughout their growth period. Further, glycinebetaine was found in tissues of the aerial and root portions. These results of the accumulation of organic solutes in the cells suggests an osmotic regulatory mechanism},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA To understand how cells sense and respond to salt stress, we investigate changes in plasmolitic concentration to NaCl of epidermal cells in Salicornia europae during the growth period. The inorganic ion concentration in tissues and plasmolitic responses to NaCl of epidermal cells in wild Salicornia were compared with other halophytes. Cell responses to high salt concentration were compared with plants grown in MS medium as a low salinity. The incipient plasmolytic NaCl concentration in epidermal cells in Salicornia stems rose from 1.6% to 2.2% during the growth period. Main inorganic ions in Salicornia at the end of growth stage were 63 mM Na+ and 107 mM Cl- per 100 g fresh weight. When plants were grown in MS medium, the size of epidermal cells was about 2 fold large, and osmotic pressure in plants was 35-50% low compared with wild plant cells. Incipient plasmolytic NaCl concentration in epidermal cells of plants grown in wild and MS medium was almost same. However, most of the epidermal cells grown in MS medium showed severe plasmolysis under hypertonic NaCl solutions. The results suggest that the cells of Salicornia can accumulate NaCl during the growth period and accumulated NaCl may make adjustment of osmotic pressure in the cells. By contrast with other halophytes, Salicornia showed high Na+ and Cl- concentrations in tissues and high plasmolitic concentration to NaCl in epidermal cells},

The present work was an investigation of NaCl accumulation at the organ level in Salicomia plants. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in various different organs was also determined, by chemical and histochemical methods, in order to determine the possibility that acetylcholine (ACh) functions in Na+ and Cl- transport between organelles. High NaCl accumulation occurred in roots and in lower stems. At 5 months after germination, Salicomia plants had accumulated approximately 160 nmol and 320 nmol/100 g fresh weight of Na+ and Cl- respectively in roots. High AChE activity was also observed in roots and in lower stems. The enzyme activity in stems was higher at nodes than internodes. Histochemically, AChE activity in roots was detected in the cortex, including endodermal cells around the vascular system, and strongly in endodermis, cortex and epidermis at the parting portion of lateral root from the main root. In stems, AChE activity was detected in endodermal cells around the vascular system and concentratively at the node connected with the branch in the stem. These results suggest the possibility that ion transport at the node connected with the branch in the stem, and the parting portion of the lateral root from the main root is facilitated by ACh function. Furthermore, excessive NaCl may be excreted through the epidermal cells of roots},

  Abstract                 = {The endemic New Zealand mistletoe Peraxilla tetrapetala (Loranthaceae) has previously been shown to be pollinator limited, and to experience higher fruit set in increasingly fragmented habitats, but the mechanism for higher fruit set on edges has not been studied. Edges could affect plant resources (through higher light) and/or pollinator behaviour. This study measures the degree to which pollination and resource limitation affect female reproductive success along a gradient of increasing exposure to the forest edge. Forty-two plants in pairs at varying distances from the forest edge were selected from within two Notho/agus forest fragments in the 1999/2000 season; and on one plant in each pair, all ripe undamaged flowers were hand-pollinated. Light levels and the degree of edge exposure were measured for each plant, and path analysis was used to determine the relationship of these variables to proportion fruit set. In agreement with previous studies, unmanipulated plants were found to be strongly pollen limited, especially in shady locations. However, on plants receiving hand-pollination, fruit set was uniformly high and was unaffected by edge exposure or light levels. Direct observation of flower visitation rates by birds in the 2000/01 season showed that edge flowers were visited twice as often as interior flowers. These results show that the higher fruit set on edges is due to visitation patterns of pollinators, and not due to greater resource availability on edges. This improved pollination on edges may help to buffer this declining plant against local extinction},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of enhanced UV-B radiation were investigated in the carnivorous plant Pinguicula vulgaris in a field experiment performed in Abisko, North Sweden (68 degrees 21' N, 18 degrees 49' E, 380 m above sea level). Potted plants were exposed to either ambient or ambient plus supplemental UV-B radiation, simulating a 15% ozone depletion. No effect was observed on either the epicuticular (external) or cellular (internal) UV absorbing capacity of the leaves. However, the anthocyanin content was more than doubled by supplemental UV-B radiation. In laboratory experiments, the anthocyanin rich, UV-B treated leaves were less susceptible to a lon temperature/high light photoinhibitory treatment, as judged by in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Yet, this potential benefit did not considerably affect the growth of the plant in the field (leaf area and dry mass, reproductive dry mass, flowering frequency, senescence rates, dry mass of winter buds). However, there vc as a marginally significant increase in root dry mass and in the root to shoot ratio, which may underlie the significant increase in the nitrogen content of the leaves. We suggest that P. vulgaris is resistant against UV-B radiation damage and that the possible negative effects of additional UV-B radiation on the growth of three plants may have been effectively counterbalanced by the lower risk of photoinhibition, due to the concomitant increase in anthocyanins},

  Abstract                 = {Current understanding of the extent, causes for, and consequences of variation in nutrient composition in plants is limited. Important questions to be addressed include to what extent nutrients covary, how flexible nutrient ratios are within a population or species, how reproduction influences nutrient ratios, and how much the ratios of nutrients to mass and nutrients to each other change through ontogeny. This information is needed to assess the physiological and ecological consequences of plant nutrient composition and to what extent plants function as balanced systems in acquisition and allocation of resources. We studied the variation in nutrient stoichiometry (i.e., the ratio between contents of different nutrients within a plant) in relation to three factors: (1) environmental availability of nitrogen, (2) plant size, and (3) reproductive status. We investigated these questions in 11 populations of the carnivorous plant Pinguicula vulgaris in northern Scandinavia. Dry mass and N and P content were measured for reproductive and vegetative portions of flowering individuals and for winter buds corresponding to four reproductive states: control reproductive individuals, experimentally vegetative individuals (from which flower buds were removed), adult vegetative individuals, and individuals below the threshold size for reproduction. [N], [P], and to a lesser extent, N and P content were positively related to soil N, but not to prey capture. Nutrient stoichiometry was also size dependent; in general, small plants were relatively enriched in N and relatively depleted in P compared to larger plants. Reproductive status affected not only size, but also nutrient stoichiometry of the resulting winter bud. Winter buds derived from reproductive individuals had a higher [N] and lower [P] than those of the different types of nonreproductive individuals. Our findings indicate that studies of nutrient stoichiometry in plants must go beyond links between environmental and plant nutrient concentrations to consider internal processes such as growth and reproduction},

  Abstract                 = {We measured photosynthetic performance in four subarctic carnivorous plants, Pinguicula alpina, P. Villosa, P. Vulgaris and Drosera rotundifolia, in order to test if there is a cost of combining photosynthetic and trapping devices into the same organ (leaves). We compared these data with published results on photosynthetic rates in subarctic non- carnivorous plants. In P. Vulgaris is, an experiment of prey addition and removal further tested the existence of a short- term benefit of increased nutrient gain from prey in terms of photosynthetic efficiency. Leaf area-based photosynthetic rates (P-a) ranged 2.0-3.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), dry mass-based photosynthetic rates (P- w) 42-69 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1), and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) 29-45 mu mol CO2 mol N-1 s(-1). In general, P-a and P-w of carnivorous plants increased with leaf nitrogen content. When each species was analysed separately, those relationships were weak (P. Alpina and P. Villosa) or non-significant (P. Vulgaris is and D. Rotundifolia). The photosynthetic rate of carnivorous plants was lower than that of other subarctic growth forms. In addition, P-w for a given leaf nitrogen content was significantly lower in carnivorous plants than in non- carnivorous ones. No change in P-a, P-w or PNUE occurred as a result of prey capture manipulation, but treatments differed only slightly in nutrient content. P-w and PNUE: showed a trend to be higher in reproductive P. Alpina plants as compared to vegetative ones. In P. Vulgaris, however, an increased leaf respiration was found in reproductive plants},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Some of the proximate factors that would induce aboveground stems to produce adventitious roots were investigated experimentally on Senecio cooperi, a tropical cloud forest tree. Stem segments were air-layered with different treatments to promote root formation, and the number of roots initiated and rates of root growth were monitored for 20 weeks. Treatments were the application of wet epiphytes or dry epiphytes plus associated humuns, sponges wetted with either water or nutrient solutions, or dry sponges. Controls (stem segments with nothing applied) were also monitored. Numbers of adventitious roots formed and rates of subsequent root growth differed among treatments. Wet epiphyte/humus and nutrient solutions were most effective in producing roots, which suggests that epiphytes and the nutrients they intercept and retain within the canopy may cue adjacent host tissue to exploit this resource},

  Abstract                 = {Mangroves and seagrass beds are considered important nursery habitats for coral reef fish species in the Caribbean, but it is not known to what degree the fish depend on these habitats. The fish fauna of 11 different inland bays of the Caribbean island of Curacao were compared; the bays contain 4 different habitat types: seagrass beds in bays containing mangroves, seagrass beds in bays lacking mangroves, mud flats in bays containing mangroves and seagrass beds, and mud flats in bays completely lacking mangroves and seagrass beds. Principal component analysis showed a high similarity of fish fauna among bays belonging to each of the 4 habitat types, despite some differences in habitat variables and human influence between bays. Juveniles of nursery species- fish species using mangroves and seagrass beds as juvenile nurseries before taking up residence on reefs-showed highest abundance and species richness on the seagrass beds, and on the mud flats near mangroves and seagrass beds, but were almost absent from bays containing only mud flats. The high abundance and species richness on the mud flats near nursery habitats can be explained by fishes migrating from the adjacent mangroves/seagrass beds to the mud flats. Seagrass beds near to mangroves showed a higher richness of nursery species than did seagrass beds alone, suggesting an interaction with the mangroves resulting in an enhancement of species richness. Comparison of fish densities from the 4 different habitat types indicates that for the nursery species the degree of dependence on a combination of mangroves and seagrass beds as nurseries for juvenile fish is high for Ocyurus chrysurus and Scarus iserti, the dependence on seagrass beds is high for Haemulon parrai, H, sciurus, Lutjanus apodus, L, griseus, Sparisoma chrysopterum and Sphyraena barracuda, and the dependence on mud flats near mangroves/seagrass beds is high for L. Analis. The dependence on mangroves and/or seagrass beds is low for Chaetodon capistratus, Gerres cinereus, H, flavolineatum and L. Mahogoni, which can also use alternative nursery habitats},

  Abstract                 = {This study was undertaken in summer on fully expanded leaves of Avicennia marina trees in the Beachwood Mangroves Nature Reserve, Durban, South Africa. Data sets were obtained over 5-7 days of relatively dry conditions and over two periods of 5 days during which the swamp was continuously inundated with dilute seawater (<150 mol m(-3) NaCl). Gas exchange responses were strongly influenced by photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), leaf temperature and leaf to air vapour pressure deficit law). Carbon dioxide exchange was saturated at a PPFD of about 800 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Maximal CO2 exchange rates ranged from 8.5 to 9.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with no differences between drained and waterlogged conditions. Under drained conditions, leaf conductance, transpiration and internal CO2 concentrations were generally lower, and water use efficiencies higher, than during waterlogging. Continuous waterlogging for 5 days had no adverse effect on CO2 exchange. Xylem water potentials ranged from -1.32 to -3.53 MPa during drained and from -1.02 to -2.65 MPa during waterlogged conditions. These results are discussed in relation to anatomical and metabolic adaptations of A. Marina to waterlogging stress},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Continuous measurements of gas exchange characteristics were made on two to nine year old hydroponically grown Avicennia germinans (L.) Steam, Aegialitis annulata R. Br. and Aegiceras corniculatum (L.) Blanco maintained at 50 or 500 mol m(-3) NaCl. In Avicennia germinans and Aegialitis annulata, CO2 assimilation rates were initially higher at 500 mol m(-3) NaCl and decreased gradually towards the end of the photoperiod when rates were similar to those at the lower salinity. In Aegiceras corniculatum, assimilation rates were higher at 50 mol m(-3) NaCl and about 55% lower at the higher salinity. In all three species, leaf conductance and transpiration exhibited trends similar to those for CO2 assimilation. Intercellular CO2 concentrations were similar at both salinities in Avicennia germinans and Aegialitis annulata, but considerably higher at the lower salinity in Aegiceras corniculatum. Water use efficiencies (WUE), although similar between salinity treatments in Avicennia germinans and Aegialitis annulata, were greater at the higher salinity in Aegiceras corniculatum. Data obtained from CO2 response curves indicated that assimilation at high salinity in Aegiceras corniculatum was limited by conductance, and to a lesser extent, by photosynthetic capacity. In Avicennia germinans and Aegialitis annulata, assimilation was greater at the higher salinity as indicated by increase in both the initial slope and the upper plateau of the CO2 response data. Greater assimilation at high salinity in Avicennia germinans and Aegialitis annulata may be attributed to lower carbon losses via photorespiration and to efficient salt excretion and sequestration},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen stable isotope ratio techniques were used in 1989 and 1990 to evaluate the relative importance of algae and of mangrove detritus in the nutrition of two penaeid prawn species on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Mangrove detritus was found to contribute to the nutrition of juvenile Penaeus merguiensis de Man living within tidal creeks, but not to adult P. merguiensis and juvenile and adult Parapenaeopsis sculptilis (Heller) captured offshore. Results from radiotracer feeding studies, with refractory C-14 mangrove lignocellulose as the food source, indicated that juvenile P. merguiensis from tidal creeks assimilated mangrove carbon with an effciency of 13.4%. This did not differ significantly (P = 0.05) from the assimilation efficiencies of juvenile and adult P. sculptilis living offshore (10.0 and 10.9%, respectively); these values were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than for adult P. merguiensis (2.1%). Thus, the differential contribution of mangrove material to the nutrition of prawns in the tidal creeks and offshore was not related to differences in the prawn's ability to utilize detritus. Instead, our analysis of C stable isotopes in sediments indicated that mangrove detritus was generally more abundant within the tidal creeks than offshore. Juvenile prawns in the tidal creeks may also utilize mangrove material indirectly by feeding on small detritivorous invertebrates. Stable isotope analyses suggest that benthic microalgae constitute the other major dietary component for prawns living in tidal creeks, Prawns offshore were utilizing mainly phytoplankton-based material Article},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen stable isotope ratio techniques were used in 1989 and 1990 to evaluate the relative importance of algae and of mangrove detritus in the nutrition of two penaeid prawn species on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Mangrove detritus was found to contribute to the nutrition of juvenile Penaeus merguiensis de Man living within tidal creeks, but not to adult P. merguiensis and juvenile and adult Parapenaeopsis sculptilis (Heller) captured offshore. Results from radiotracer feeding studies, with refractory C-14 mangrove lignocellulose as the food source, indicated that juvenile P. merguiensis from tidal creeks assimilated mangrove carbon with an effciency of 13.4%. This did not differ significantly (P = 0.05) from the assimilation efficiencies of juvenile and adult P. sculptilis living offshore (10.0 and 10.9%, respectively); these values were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than for adult P. merguiensis (2.1%). Thus, the differential contribution of mangrove material to the nutrition of prawns in the tidal creeks and offshore was not related to differences in the prawn's ability to utilize detritus. Instead, our analysis of C stable isotopes in sediments indicated that mangrove detritus was generally more abundant within the tidal creeks than offshore. Juvenile prawns in the tidal creeks may also utilize mangrove material indirectly by feeding on small detritivorous invertebrates. Stable isotope analyses suggest that benthic microalgae constitute the other major dietary component for prawns living in tidal creeks, Prawns offshore were utilizing mainly phytoplankton-based material Article},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Modular growth generates at least three kinds of hierarchies: morphological, functional, and demographic. The morphological hierarchy corresponds to the phenotypic characters of both the units (modules) that are repeated by developmental processes, and the units (organisms, colonies, and clones) that develop by iteration, specialization and integration of modules. The functional hierarchy concerns the levels of interaction or, in evolutionary terms, the functional relationships between fitness and the phenotypic characters at different levels of modular organization. Finally, clonal growth and reproduction results in a nested hierarchy of demographic units that are replicated by asexual propagation. Each level of the demographic hierarchy that is characterized by specific birth and death rate, is a potential candidate for evaluating fitness. We propose a formal approach in order to analyze the hierarchical structure of phenotypic selection in modular organisms, and to evaluate the selective importance of various levels of modular organization. We derive a measure of selective importance from the sensitivity of fitness to a unit change in the characters of a given level: the sum of squared sensitivities associated with that level. We propose that clonal-level characters of disintegrated clones will make small contributions to the variation in fitness, while such characters will be more important if the clone is physically and physiologically integrated. Moreover, we present a decomposition of fitness variation in relation to the levels of trait variation. This decomposition demonstrates that the levels where variation in fitness is observed do not always correspond to the interaction-levels at which the causal agents of selection are acting on particular traits. Following the logic of phenotypic optimization models, we consider three examples of selection in order to examine whether the different demographic levels are equally suitable for evaluating fitness. In two examples of density-independent selection we show that the Malthusian parameter is identical at all levels in the hierarchy. However, the third example shows that this result is not valid in density- dependent selection models. The way density-dependent regulation is supposed to operate in the model system determines which of the demographic levels should be used to evaluate fitness. Consequently, there is no fundamental demographic level that should a priori be chosen when measuring fitness},

  Abstract                 = {Lobelia dortmanna is a vascular macrophyte of the isoetid life form which grows in sandy sediments of nutrient-poor lakes and may become exposed to the air during summer months. Both land and water forms of Lobelia have short stiff leaves which lack stomata and are covered by a thick cuticle providing high resistance to gas exchange and water loss. Incessant large air lacunae run between leaf and root.tips. With the leaves exposed to atmospheric air, both life forms absorb virtually all CO2 by the roots from the CO2-rich sediments (ca 30 times air level) and release a substantial proportion of the O2 produced during photosynthesis. The thick cuticle and lack of stomata maintain high CO2 concentrations (ca 23 times air level) for photosynthesis within the leaf lacunae. Release of O2 via the roots and low O2 consumption rates in the sandy sediments result in the presence of dissolved O2 in the pore water and higher daytime concentrations than during night. Root oxygenation may assist in the acquisition of limiting nutrient resources in the infertile habitat. We propose that the special morphology and the predominant root exchange of CO2 and O2 evolved on land before Lobelia dortmanna became submerged},

  Abstract                 = {Differences in initial large-scale disturbances might change effects of subsequent large-scale disturbances. We explored possible effects of prior fire regimes on subsequent hurricane-related mortality of south Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa) in remnant Everglades pine savannas that were unburned, burned during the wet (lightning fire) season, or burned during the dry (anthropogenic fire) season in the decade before Hurricane Andrew (1992). We measured direct mortality during Andrew (snapped trees) and extended mortality over the subsequent 24-30 mo (mainly insect attacks on damaged trees). We used Bayesian model averaging to obtain probabilities of different models of survival based on fire regime and site characteristics (remnant area, distance to the Atlantic Ocean, depth to water table in the dry season, sustained wind speeds, tree sizes). Most likely models for direct and extended mortality included large negative effects of tree size and dry-season fire regime, and positive effects of stand, area (direct mortality) and wet-season fire regime (extended mortality). Depth to water table and distance to the ocean had less certain effects. Our results, not predicted from fires or hurricanes alone, suggest that anthropogenic changes to dry-season fires strongly influence the effects of subsequent hurricanes on the mortality of pines in subtropical savannas},

Landscape influence was evaluated indirectly by determining whether seed banks in wetlands close to clearcuts had more upland weedy species than those farther from clearcuts. Seed bank species composition and richness differed among forested, shrubby and herbaceous bays. DECORANA ordination identified a gradient of species composition from herbaceous bays, to shrubby bays, to forested bays. Bays near clearcuts had significantly more upland weedy species in their seed banks, with bays 20 m from clearcuts containing 79% more weedy species on average than bays 100 m from clearcuts. Within a bay, drier vegetation zones had 2.4 times more weedy species than did deep water zones. These results illustrate the potential contributions from surrounding landscape units to bay seed banks and highlight the need for further studies directly assessing the impact of adjacent clearcuts on bay vegetation dynamics Article},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA TV859 Polis GA, Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol, Nashville,TN 37235 USA English Review This study quantifies the how of energy and biomass from a productive marine system to a relatively unproductive terrestrial system. Biomass from marine food webs (here, the Gulf of California) enters the terrestrial webs of islands and coastal areas through two conduits: (1) shore drift of algal wrack and carrion and (2) colonies of seabirds. Both conduits support dense assemblages of consumers: arthropods are 85-560 times more abundant in the supralittoral than inland and 2.2 times more abundant on islands with seabird colonies than those without. Marine input (MI), not terrestrial primary productivity (TP) by land plants, provides most energy and biomass for terrestrial communities on 16 of 19 study islands. The ratio of perimeter to area (PIA) significantly predicts arthropod abundance on islands and is the major determinant of the relative importance of allochthonous how; we expect PIA ratio to be important wherever transport of nutrients, detritus, and organisms among habitats occurs. Similar transport phenomena generally take place, often with significant impact, on coastal habitats and islands worldwide. Such input subsidizes a diverse array of terrestrial consumers; in many cases, subsidized consumers reach extraordinarily high densities and thus can depress their in situ resources. In general, we propose that such flow is often a key feature of the energetics, structure, and dynamics of populations, food webs, and communities whenever any two habitats, differing in productivity, are juxtaposed},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA UK768 Strong DR, Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol, Box 93, Nashville,TN 37235 USA English Review Food webs in nature have multiple, reticulate connections between a diversity of consumers and resources. Such complexity affects web dynamics: it first spreads the direct effects of consumption and productivity throughout the web rather than focusing them at particular ''trophic levels.'' Second, consumer densities are often donor controlled with food from across the trophic spectrum, the herbivore and detrital channels, other habitats, life-history omnivory, and even trophic mutualism. Although consumers usually do not affect these resources, increased numbers often allow consumers to depress other resources to levels lower than if donor-controlled resources were absent. We propose that such donor-controlled and ''multichannel'' omnivory is a general feature of consumer control and central to food web dynamics. This observation is contrary to the normal practice of inferring dynamics by simplifying webs into a few linear ''trophic levels,'' as per ''green world'' theories. Such theories do not accommodate common and dynamically important features of real webs such as the ubiquity of donor control and the importance and dynamics of detritus, omnivory, resources crossing habitats, life history, nutrients (as opposed to energy), pathogens, resource defenses, and trophic symbioses. We conclude that trophic cascades and top- down community regulation as envisioned by trophic-level theories are relatively uncommon in nature},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA WQ529 Ponder WF, Australian Museum, Div Invertebrate Zool, 6 Coll St, Sydney, NSW 2000, AUSTRALIA English Review Morphological (including ultlastructural) and developmental characters utilized in recent literature are critically reviewed as the basis to reassess the phylogenetic relationships of gastropods. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework of characters fbr future studies and a testable phylogenetic hypothesis. This ii one of the first attempts to use such characters to assess the relationships of all major clades using parsimony methods. The analysis uses 117 characters and includes 40 taxa, predominantly 'prosobranchs'. Five outgroup taxa are included, representing four conchiferan groups and Poly placophora. Of the 117 characters reviewed and included in the analyses, nine are shell characters (four of these are shell structure), two opercular, two muscular, four ctenidial, 12 renopericardial and 24 reproductive (including 17 based on sperm and spermatogenesis), 27 of the digestive system, 32 of tile nervous system and sense organs; the remainder are developmental (3) and of the foot and hypobranchial gland. In the initial analysis the data set included a mixture of binary and multistate characters with all characters unordered. These data were also analysed after scaling so that each character had equal weight. A third data set was constructed in which all characters were coded as binary characters. These analyses resulted ill some implausible character transformations, mainly involving the regaining of lost pallial structures. Additional analyses were run on all three sets of data after removing five characters showing the most unlikely transformations. These analyses resulted in generally similar topologies. The robustness of the clades was tested using clade decay. The adaptive radiation of gastropods and their life history traits are briefly described and discussed and the terminology for simultaneous hermaphroditism refined. A scenario for the evolution of torsion equated with the fossil record is proposed and the effects of torsion and coiling on gastropods are discussed along with asymmetry imposed by limper-shaped body forms. It is suggested that the first gastropods were ultradextral . The idea that heterochrony has played a major part in gastropod evolution is developed and discussed, particularly the paedomorphic stamp imposed on the apogastropods. The veliger larvac of caenogastropods and heterobranchs are contrasted and found to differ in many respects. The evolution of planktotrophy within gastropods is discussed. Recent phylogenetic hypotheses for gastropods based on molecular data are generally in broad agreement with the present results. On the basis of our analyses we discuss the major monophyletic groups within gastropods. Gastropods appear to be a monophyletic clade, and divide into two primary groups, the Eogastropoda (incorporating the patellogastropods and their (probably sinistrally coiled) ancestors and the Orthogastropoda - the remainder of the gastropods. Orthogastropoda comprises several well defined clades. The vetigastropod clade encompasses most of the groups previously included in the paraphyletic Archaeogastropoda (fissurellids, trochoideans, scissurelloideans, halioroideans pleurotomarioideans) as well as lepetodriloidean and lepetelloidean limpers and seguenzids. The location of the hut vent taxa Peltospiridae and Neomphalidae varies with each analysis, probably because there a a lack of ultrastructural data for these taxa and parallelism in many characters. They tither form a paraphyletic or monophyletic group al or near the base of the vetigastropods or a clade with the neritopsines and cocculinoideans. The neritopsines (Neritoidea etc. ) consistently form a clade with the cucculinoidean limpets, bur their position on the tree also differs depending on the data set used and (in the case of the scaled data) whether or not the full suite of characters is used. They are either tile sister to the rest of the orthogastropods or to the apogastropods. Caenogastropods [Mesogastropoda (+ architaenioglossan groups) + Neogastropodal] are consistently monophyletic as are the heterobranchs ('Heterostropha' + Opisthobranchia + Pulmonata). The caenogastropods and heterobranchs also form a clade in all the analyses and the name Apogastropoda is redefined to encompass this group. New taxa are proposed, Sorbeoconcha for the caenogastropods exclusive of the architaenioglossan taxa, and Hypsogastropoda for the 'higher caenogastropods' - the Sorbeoconcha exclusive of the Cerithioidea and Campaniloidea.

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Leaf phenology of tropical forests is distinct from other biomes. Unlike the marked temperature-related periodicity of temperate forests, development tends to be continuous in aseasonal lowland tropical rain forests and becomes more episodic in response to increasing annual drought in tropical dry forests. Hence, in tropical rain forests, foliar development (production, senescence, and longevity) is largely under internal rather than environmental control. In contrast, tropical forests with marked annual dry seasons display associated seasonality of leaf production and shedding. This developmental seasonality can be explained by overlaying the influence of seasonality on trees' internally regulated development and appears to be controlled by acclimative physiological processes and not by sensitivity to photo-, thermo- periodic, or direct environmental cues. Consequences of tropical phenology stem from both the variety of leaf and species ecophysiological types common to a given moisture regime and their relative synchrony of development, and include the following: larger diversity of ecophysiological species types in rain than dry forests; differential rates of herbivory in dry than wet seasons and for synchronous versus asynchronous leaf flushes; ecosystems with greater canopy foliar mass per hectare in rain than dry forests; and several leaf adaptations perhaps unique to tropical forests, such as delayed greening and seasonal leaf phenotypes. Tropical forests may vary in sensitivity to predicted climate change. Phenology of rain forests should change little unless water balance changes markedly, and developmental events in rain forests may be relatively insensitive to moderate changes in CO2 or temperature. Phenology of dry forests could be more sensitive, and in opposite directions, to elevated CO2 and temperatures. Elevated CO2 might delay the onset of leaf shedding and stimulate longer life span if stand level transpiration is reduced, whereas higher temperatures could lead to more rapid water depletion, longer leafless periods, and more strongly synchronized phenology},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA VR747 Roberts DE, Wyong Shire Council, POB 20, Wyong, NSW 2259, AUSTRALIA English Article Pattern and process in deep-water macrobenthic assemblages have largely been inferred from the study of such assemblages on shaded artificial structures in relatively shallow water. This paper examines patterns in the diversity and abundance of sponges to a depth of 50 m on coastal reefs off Sydney, Australia. Photo- quadrats were used to provide estimates of the species richness and percentage cover of sponges on three reefs. Sponge morphotype (i.e. Encrusting or massive) was also recorded. Within-reef variation was examined by nesting three sites within each reef at each of three depths; replicate photo-quadrats (0.45 m(2), n = 5) were taken at each site. In addition, a remotely operated vehicle was used to collect voucher specimens. Over 50 species of sponge were identified, many of which have never been described. In general, sponge richness increased with depth, as did the number of erect or massive forms. In contrast, cover decreased with depth, particularly for encrusting sponges. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed considerable small-scale spatial and temporal variation in sponge distribution and abundance. A significant positive relationship between richness and cover was also apparent. In general, there were greater temporal changes in the patterns of abundance for the shallow reef assemblages at 20 m, relative to those at 30 m and 50 m},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Within the last decade three new statistical paradigms have emerged for analysing directional variates and modelling non- linear dynamical systems-circular statistics, fractal geometry and chaos theory. Although the directional effects of wind on agricultural crops and trees have been described from ancient times, it has mainly been within the last two decades that formal statistical tests of directionality, known as circular and spherical statistics, have been developed. Circular and spherical statistics have been applied in biology and geostatistics but rarely in biometeorology. Similarly, the time-honoured Euclidean geometry, based on the idealized simplicity of homogeneity and symmetry, have prevailed. Euclidean geometry is inadequate for describing the geometry of many objects, particularly the myriad of scaling factors, lacunarity and heterogeneity of agricultural crops, trees and forests. To deal with these problems the notion of fractal geometry-the calculus of heterogeneity-was introduced. Mathematics and statistical theory are rooted in the belief that physical systems can potentially be described and predicted. However, the new paradigm of chaos theory clearly shows that this is not the case for most, if not all, non-linear phenomena. Undoubtedly, the interaction between wind and forests is a non- linear system within which, to use a well-worn cliche, short-term prediction is possible whereas long-term prediction is not. This paper provides a brief overview of the application of these new paradigms to the study of wind effects on forests, drawing mainly on exploratory work conducted on the wave forest phenomena in Newfoundland},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Trawling for penaeid prawns has been suggested to have major effects on the size of sea populations in Australia and overseas. The numbers of turtles caught and killed in the Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery were estimated from a 2-year programme monitoring turtle captures in this commercial prawn trawl fishery. A sample of about 50 commercial fishers participated and reported an average catch rate of 0.068 turtles per day fished. Loggerhead Caretta caretta (50.4%), green Chelonia mydas (30.1%) and flatback Natator depressus (10.9%) turtles comprised the main species caught. An estimated 5295 +/- 1231 turtles were caught annually by the Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery, which has an annual fishing effort of 80,558 days. About 1.1% of captured turtles were reported dead when landed. This mortality rate is lower than those reported for other trawl fisheries because in the Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery tow durations are short (<80 min) where turtles are commonly caught. Potentially, if all comatose turtles are assumed to die, the mortality rate of trawl caught turtles could be as high as 6.8%. However, the true mortality rate is probably somewhere between 1.1% and 6.8% of turtles landed because some commercial fishers resuscitate trawl-caught turtles Article},

  Abstract                 = {Symbiosis of bacteria and algae with protoctists and fungi, plants and animals may involve the coexistence of two different genomes in the same cell or organism. Even if gene transfer between the symbiotic partners is restricted or absent, symbiotic integration involves signal transduction systems and specific epigenetic processes of reciprocal gene modulation that occur through a complex molecular cross-talk between the symbionts. Although especially studied for the Rhizobium-Leguminosae association the fine tuning of symbiont recognition and regulation occurs as well in other symbioses. New morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations arising in symbiotic associations, as the light organ of squids, result from morphogenetic and biochemical constraints driven by epigenetic processes. In this context, we consider the secondary acquisition of photosynthesis due to symbiosis with cyanobacteria, zoochlorellae and zooxanthellae, which occur in several sponges. According to recent observations on the Mediterranean sponge Petrosia ficiformis this kind of symbiosis induces relevant morphological and physiological adaptations in the sponge. Symbiosis with heterotrophic bacteria, as occurs in the sponge Chondrosia reniformis, seems also to influence the physiology and the behavior of the sponge significantly. The evolutionary significance of the new genetic-epigenetic mechanisms arising from the symbionts interaction is examined in the light of recent views on the epigenetic inheritance systems. It is suggested that symbiotic innovations can follow a two-step (epigenetic and selective) gradualist evolutionary model. This model states that the epigenetic processes due to the symbiont interaction, induce phenotypic changes which, because inherited, are submitted to selection in the course of generations},

In three sites at different points in the forest harvest cycle at Matang, the density and biomass of epifaunal taxa was found to be greatest in mature Rhizophora apiculata Lamk, forest, intermediate in a 15-year old stand, and lowest in recently cleared forest. The pattern in infaunal taxa was found to be different, with the greatest density and biomass in the recently cleared site. A number of diversity indices highlight the low diversity of epifaunal taxa in the recently cleared site, perhaps a consequence of the drier substrate surface in the absence of a tree canopy},

  Abstract                 = {An increased understanding of the role of early life history stages in determining the distributions of benthic invertebrates require studies covering a wide range of habitats, and preferably multiple scales. For one of the more prominent invertebrate groups, intertidal barnacles, much of our existing knowledge is drawn from studies of rocky shores, with few studies from other habitats. Here, we describe the distribution of adults of the temperate barnacle Elminius covertus in mangrove (Avicennia marina) forests of southeastern Australia. We sampled E. Covertus on pneumatophores over a large-scale (50-100 m) across the forests from the landward to seaward edges. We also described large scale patterns along the shore (also a scale of 100 m). At the seaward edge of the forest, on a small spatial scale, the vertical distribution of E. Covertus on pneumatophores over 15 cm was also investigated. Settlement and recruitment were also estimated by allowing barnacles to settle on artificial substrata. The processes influencing the patterns of adults of E. Covertus were very different over the two major scales in this study. At the large-scale, adult Elminius covertus were abundant at the seaward edges of forests, declining through the forest, and were absent at the landward sections of forests. Recruitment, measured over 1 month, and 1 week, matched this pattern, and settlement, measured over a single high tide, also matched the adult distributions. Along the shore, differences in abundance of adult barnacles were matched by variation in settlement and recruitment. Post-settlement mortality had little influence on this pattern. In contrast, on the small, vertical scale, barnacles were most abundant on the upper 5 cm of pneumatophores, and least common near the substratum, This vertical pattern reflected the pattern of recruitment after 1 month. Settlement, however, was different, with more settlement on the 5 cm of pneumatophores closest to the substratum. The distribution of recruits after 1 week was intermediate between settlement and recruitment after 1 month. The vertical pattern of adults is therefore determined by post-settlement mortality occurring during the first month after settlement. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved},

  Abstract                 = {Many ecological studies require analysis of collections of estimates. For example, population change is routinely estimated for many species from surveys such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), and the species are grouped and used in comparative analyses. We developed a hierarchical model for estimation of group attributes from a collection of estimates of population trend. The model uses information from predefined groups of species to provide a context and to supplement data for individual species; summaries of group attributes are improved by statistical methods that simultaneously analyze collections of trend estimates. The model is Bayesian; trends are treated as random variables rather than fixed parameters. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the model. Standard assessments of population stability cannot distinguish magnitude of trend and statistical significance of trend estimates, but the hierarchical model allows us to legitimately describe the probability that a trend is within given bounds. Thus we define population stability in terms of the probability that the magnitude of population change for a species is less than or equal to a predefined threshold. We applied the model to estimates of trend for 399 species from the BBS to estimate the proportion of species with increasing populations and to identify species with unstable populations. Analyses are presented for the collection of all species and for 12 species groups commonly used in BBS summaries. Overall, we estimated that 49% of species in the BBS have positive trends and 33 species have unstable populations. However, the proportion of species with increasing trends differs among habitat groups, with grassland birds having only 19% of species, with positive trend estimates and wetland birds having 68% of species with positive trend estimates},

  Abstract                 = {The role of historical events, such as disturbances, in producing alternative developmental outcomes in forest structure has long been debated. Diversity in the assemblages of coexisting species is one measure of alternative outcomes of succession. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis proposes that a moderate disturbance level produces the highest levels of species diversity. Here, we use an agent-based model of forest development under a gradient of lightning strike frequency to analyse long-term dynamics of species coexistence in a multispecies forest. The configurations of species that result from disturbance dynamics reflect the interactions between life-history characteristics of the species and disturbance characteristics. Model results suggest that low levels of disturbance lead to highly ordered landscapes which exclude fire and are captured by late successional species. High levels of disturbance lead to oscillation between domination by early successional species and large disturbances. At intermediate levels of disturbance, the forest displays the broadest array of developmental pathways, highest entropy as measured by Shannon's index of diversity, and critical slowing near steady states. Long transients at intermediate regimes may reflect the working out of closely balanced constraints of competition between species with varying strategic adaptations to disturbance. Intermediate disturbance levels also result in the greatest number of alternative diversity configurations as outcomes of succession, reflecting an unpredictable and nonequilibrium forest dynamic.

  Abstract                 = {Aim To explore the biogeographic patterns of exotic species in order to discriminate between hypotheses postulated to produce several biogeographic phenomena: the latitudinal gradient in species richness, the latitudinal gradient in species geographical range size (Rapoport's rule), species geographical range boundaries and patterns of invasion in the tropics. Location Data were taken from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and oceanic islands. Methods The latitudinal extents of the geographical range of exotic species were recorded to the nearest 1 degrees of latitude from several published sources. Species richness was tabulated by recording the number of naturalized species present within 5 degrees bands of latitude. Rapoport's rule was calculated by averaging the latitudinal extent of all exotic species present within 5 degrees bands. The low- latitude boundaries of species' native and naturalized ranges were compared with the nearest 1 degrees of latitude. These comparisons on continents were contrasted with those on islands. Results Within the tropics, few exotic species have become naturalized and those that are have established large geographical ranges. Outside of the tropics, exotic species of birds, mammals, fishes and plants demonstrate qualitatively similar latitudinal gradients in richness and geographical range size. They show the same patterns as native species, where richness is negatively correlated and range size positively correlated with latitude. Further, the geographical ranges of naturalized species on continents rarely extend to latitudes lower than those in their native ranges. On islands (where biotic pressure is reduced) exotic species are more frequently naturalized at latitudes lower than those in their native ranges. Main conclusions Hypotheses for the latitudinal gradient in species richness and geographical range size that are based on past glaciation events or differential rates of speciation between regions may not be necessary to explain these gradients, as exotic species are recent colonists and their patterns of distribution cannot have been directly affected by past glaciation events or differential rates of speciation between regions. Further, the low-latitude boundary of species geographical ranges may be set by tolerance for biotic pressure},

  Abstract                 = {Endosymbiotic zooxanthellae, referred to Symbiodinium microadriaticum, are described in the non-bioeroding sponge Cinachyra tarentina Pulitzer-Finali,1983, by both light and transmission electron microscopy. The algae are intracellular, included in individual vacuoles of mesohyl cells, inside which they were observed in division. More than one zooxanthella may live in a sponge cell. The zooxanthellae measured about 8-9 mu m in diameter. No difference in their diameter was detected in relation to the location in the sponge body. Monthly sponge samplings over one year (from January to December 1996), allowed the presence/absence of the zooxanthellae to be ascertained. A total of 139 sponges were examined, the majority of which (112 specimens) harboured symbionts. The number of sponges lacking zooxanthellae progressively decreased with the approach of summer. From August to October all the specimens contained zooxanthellae. Typically, zooxanthellae have been recorded in clionids and their presence has generally been correlated with the boring activity and growth of these sponges. The present report shows no evidence of constraints in the evolution of the association between sponges and zooxanthellae along with a possible non-vertical transfer of symbionts to the new generations},

Because this area has a long history of human exploitation and private land ownership direct purchase as a park is unfeasible and inappropriate. The alternative conservation strategy that has been adopted is to create a 'green line' park, the Pinelands National Reserve, in which all of the land included within the boundaries of the Reserve is subject to regulations on building and development, while some of the most critical areas are protected by purchase. Conservationists used the strong base of scientific knowledge of the area and theory to gain protection for fragile ecosystems. This use of emerging theory to protect parts of the landscape is an example of the kind of innovative planning that is necessary to protect land in areas where there is already much human impact and pressure for development},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Preliminary estimates of the ratio of mangrove forest: shrimp pond area necessary to remove nutrients from shrimp pond effluent are made using budgets of nitrogen and phosphorus output for semi- intensive and intensive shrimp ponds combined with estimates of total net primary production in Rhizophora-dominated mangrove forests in tropical coastal areas. If effluent is delivered directly to mangrove forest plots, it is estimated that, depending on shrimp pond management, between 2 and 22 hectares of forest are required to filter the nitrogen and phosphorus loads from effluent produced by a 1 hectare pond. While such ratios may apply to small scale, integrated shrimp aquaculture - mangrove forestry farming systems, the variability in mangrove hydrodynamics makes it difficult to apply such ratios at a regional scale. Before mangroves can be used to strip shrimp pond effluent more research is required on the effects that high ammonia and particulate organic matter loads in pond effluent have on nutrient transformations in mangrove sediments and on forest growth},

We described and compared the structure and composition of the plant communities of three stands of each type (planted, naturally regenerated, and mature). Increment cores were analyzed to reconstruct developmental trends. Future trends were predicted from analyses of the midstory and understory composition. Both planting and natural regeneration adequately replaced the structural attributes of the historical bottomland forest. The existing structural differences are expected to diminish over time. Neither regeneration method replaced the wildlife value of the mature bottomland forests due to insufficient establishment and subsequent ingrowth of heavy mast species (particularly oaks and hickories). There was evidence that the understory species compositions of the restored forest types were similar to that of the mature stand type. All forests, including the mature stands, appeared to be succeeding from hydric to mesic species compositions as a result of human- altered hydrology and natural floodplain processes. We speculate that the historical bottomland species composition will probably not persist on any of the study sites in the long term},

  Abstract                 = {Existing at the interface of land and sea, in regions of low topographic relief, mangroves are likely to be some of the first ecosystems that undergo spatial modification due to sea-level rise. The mangrove ecosystems of the Gulf of Papua New Guinea are some of the largest and most pristine in the Asia-Pacific region; they have not been subject to clearance for crustacean farming nor suffered from land reclamation projects. This article establishes through analysis of a time series of aerial photography and satellite imagery from the period 1973-2007, that there have been substantial changes in the distribution of mangroves in this region. These changes include the seaward progradation of the Purari Delta and the regression of the Kikori Delta by an average of 43 m year(-1) at its most seaward point. While these findings are likely to be continuations of long-term trends, it is probable that they can be explained by a variety of interacting factors including climate change, sea-level rise, subsistence in the northern Gulf of Papua and changes in sediment dynamics},

I conducted the present study to determine if estuarine populations of these 4 species did in fact contain adu lts, or if they were comprised entirely of juveniles. I collected E, coioides, E. Malabaricus, L. Russelli and L, argentimaculatus from estuaries in northeastern Australia. I compared the size, a ge and reproductive maturity of fishes from estuaries to fishes o f the same species from offshore areas. The estuarine populations of all 4 species seemed to consist entirely of reproductively im mature fish. All fish from the estuaries possessed immature gonad s, and for both serranids (protogynous hermaphrodites) all were f emales. Furthermore, all fish from the estuaries were much smalle r and younger than the largest fish of the same species from offs hore. This implies that estuaries are important juvenile developm ent grounds for these lutjanids and serranids},

Both day and night samples were collected in fish traps, on four occasions, three months apart. On each sampling trip the highest number of species was trapped from snaggy habitats, intermediate numbers from clear banks or mud banks, and the fewest species from mid channels. Although more species occurred in night than in day samples, the pattern of difference among habitats was consistent. The probability of capture of the six most abundant species, Acanthopagrus australis, Acanthopagrus berda, Arothron manilensis, Arius argyropleuron, Epinephelus coioides and Lutjanus russelli, was compared among habitat types and between day and night samples. Overall, snag habitats tended to be associated with high probabilities of capture of a number of species, particularly A, berda and L. Russelli. At night, mid channels were characterized by high numbers of A. Argyropleuron. Clear and mud banks, and day samples from mid channels were associated with low numbers of most species},

Principal components analysis reduced 15 habitat parameters to four interpretable components that were used as orthogonal predictive variables in path analysis. Path analysis, with a directional model containing intermediate steps and multiple dependent variables, was used as an alternative to multiple regression. Two principal components, associated with velocity (and its covariates) and depth (and its covariates), were the primary correlates of biomass (R(2) = 49%), richness (44%), mean size (36%), and density (20%), with cover variables contributing relatively little to any R(2) value. Velocity effects were negative and depth effects positive for all collective properties. Habitat effects on biomass were mediated by effects on individual fish size rather than numbers. Correlations of collective properties at sites sampled in 2 years were similar to those from the single year, habitat-based path model, implying that the path model was adequate and inclusive, and accurately reflected collective properties of these communities},

  Abstract                 = {In evaluating the effectiveness of further sampling in species taxonomic surveys, a practical and important problem is predicting the number of new species that would be observed in a second survey, based on data from an initial survey. This problem can also be approached by estimating the corresponding expected number of new species. A. R. Solow and S. Polasky recently proposed a predictor (or estimator), with the form of a sum of many terms, that was derived under the assumption that all unobserved species in the initial sample have equal relative abundances. We show in this paper that the summation can be expressed as only one term. We provide a direct justification for the simplified estimator and connect it to an extrapolation formula based on a special type of species accumulation curve. Using the proposed justification, we show that, for large sample sizes, the estimator is also valid under an alternative condition, i.e., species that are represented the same number of times in the initial sample have equal relative abundances in the community. This condition is statistically justified from a Bayesian approach, although the estimator exhibits moderate negative bias for predicting larger samples in highly heterogeneous communities. In such situations, we recommend the use of a modified estimator that incorporates a measure of heterogeneity among species abundances. An example using field data from the extant rare vascular plant species patterns in the southern Appalachians is presented to compare the various methods},

Although all habitats were intertidal, mangroves received the shortest duration of flooding, and non- vegetated mud received the longest. Replicate cores were taken at high tide in each habitat in July, September and December 1988, and in April 1989. Seagrass substrates were low organic content sands, whereas mangrove and non-vegetated substrates were high organic content sandy clays. Over 300 taxa were recorded, most of them relatively rare, and only 32 taxa were considered dominant (averaging greater than or equal to 636 individuals m(-2) or five core(-1) in any habitat at a given time). Seagrass and non- vegetated mud faunas were more diverse than those of mangrove substrates. Total densities were always higher in red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) pear than elsewhere, averaging 22 591 to 52 914 individuals m(- 2). Densities in mixed seagrasses ranged between 6347 and 23 545 individuals m(-2), while those in non- vegetated mud ranged between 3611 and 22 465 individuals m(-2). Biomasses, however, were always higher in either seagrasses (15.7- 87.4 g wet weight m(-2)) or non-vegetated mud (11.9-26.2 g m(-2)) than in mangroves (3.6-8.2 g m(-2)). Tanaids and annelids were the numerical dominants, reaching maximum densities of 35 127 and 31 388 m(-2) respectively, in mangroves. Annelids were also the dominant biomass in most habitats each month. Variation in densities of most of the 32 dominant taxa were related to habitat not time. Each habitat harboured four to eight taxa that were significantly more abundant there than in alternate habitats. Feeding guild analysis indicated few differences among habitats, as surface deposit feeders and carnivores were predominant. Red mangrove appear capable of functioning in a manner similar to intertidal marsh habitats by providing high densities of small prey items for mobile consumers able to exploit the intertidal zone during high tide. Experimental verification of this function remains necessary. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited},

Self-pollination of mutant green individuals in four different species resulted in green offspring, whereas reciprocal crosses with respective wild-types resulted in red offspring. Three of six self-pollinated heterozygous S. Rubra ssp, gulfensis yielded offspring exhibiting a 3 red : 1 green ratio. Progeny from a testcross and two self-pollinated heterozygous plants of S. Purpurea fit the expected ratios, whereas offspring from two S. Purpurea crosses had significant deviations in field and laboratory sowing experiments. Offspring from testcrosses with S. Rubra Walter ssp.jonesii (Wherry) Wherry met expected ratios under field conditions. Interspecific crosses between green individuals resulted in green offspring. These results suggest that anthocyanin pigmentation is controlled by two alleles at a single locus, with red dominant to green},

  Abstract                 = {The insectivorous pitcher plant genus Sarracenia contains several species with mutants which lack red pigment in leaves, flowers and growth point. Mutants and wild-type contain various glycosides of the flavonols quercetin and kaempferol and we hypothesized that the blockage in the mutant occurred between either dihydroflavonols and leucoanthocyanidin or between leucoanthocyanidin and the end product anthocyanin. Acid hydrolysis and acid addition were used to quantify and qualify spectral characteristics of intermediates. Aqueous phase extracts of leaves demonstrated the end product was most likely an anthocyanin because of red color, absorption at 530 nm and miscibility with amyl alcohol. Mutants and wild-type plants in Sarracenia purpurea and S. Rubra ssp. Jonesii are capable of producing proanthocyanidins while only wild-type contain pseudobase. Sarracenia purpurea mutants had a significantly greater accumulation of proanthocyanidins than wild-type while there was no such significant difference in S. Rubra ssp, jonesii. These results suggest that the mutant is blocked in a late stage of anthocyanin biosynthesis between leucocyanidin and pseudobase. While mutants may accumulate precursors, additional investigation is needed. Sarracenia may serve as useful plants for research since the highly modified carnivorous and absorptive leaves may be fed suspected intermediates in this last step of anthocyanin synthesis.

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA The sustainability, health and biomass yields of marine resources can be enhanced by the implementation of a more holistic and ecologically based strategy for assessing, monitoring, and managing coastal ecosystems than has been generally practiced during most of this century. A major milestone was reached in advancing toward a more ecologically based management practice when the majority of coastal nations of the world endorsed the declaration made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992, to prevent, reduce, and control degradation of the marine environment, so as to maintain and improve its life-support and productive capacities; develop and increase the potential of marine living resources to meet human nutritional needs, as well as social, economic, and development goals; and promote the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas and the marine environment. The scientific framework in support of the UNCED objectives is now emerging from a series of regional efforts aimed at cross- sectoral integration of research, monitoring, and assessments conducted to mitigate stresses on coastal ecosystems from toxic effluents, habitat degradation, nutrient loadings, harmful algal blooms, aerosol contaminants, and losses of living resources from pollution and overexploitation. Discipline-oriented ecological studies can contribute more toward achievement of resource sustainability when they are conducted within a framework of science at the level of organization that is multidisciplinary and focused on populations, habitats, and ecosystems at large spatial scales. Primary, secondary, and tertiary driving forces of variability in biomass yields are examined for several large marine ecosystems, along with observations on changing states of 'health' of the systems. Marine resource problems underscored by UNCED are being addressed. Post-UNCED large marine ecosystem-scale programs for advancement toward resource sustainability, ecosystem health, and economically viable biomass yields are now being implemented. The programs are being supported by international agencies as part of an effort to couple recent advances in ecological monitoring, management, and stress mitigation strategies from the more developed countries, with the lesser developed coastal countries around the margins of the ocean basins},

Results of tests for the content of oil in sediments and organisms indicate a substantially high rate of degradation. Results for uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in bivalves suggested the recent occurrence of oil spills and that these organisms differed in their capabilities to bioconcentrate oil. The mangrove community has suffered constant inputs of oil and has responded with increased numbers of aerial roots, generation of malformed leaves and fruits by plants, and a decrease in litter production. Studies of the impact of oil on rocky shore communities and the toxicity of oil and its by-products to marine organisms have confirmed the results reported in the literature. Presently most of the available studies deal with the macroscopic effects of oil on organisms and have indicated that the nature of oil, climate characteristics, the physical environment, and the structure of the community influence the symptoms of oil contamination in organisms of coastal waters. Longterm studies should be carried out to assess changes in community structure, sublethal effects in populations, and the resilience of contaminated ecosystems},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA Predictions made by previous allometric analyses of the relationship between population density and body mass were tested using data on ecological density of 987 terrestrial mammal populations. The relationship is not log-log linear as previously postulated. Only populations of mammals with body mass between 0.1 and 100 kg had allometric exponents approaching the value of - 0.75 proposed by previous studies. Different trophic groups showed divergent relationships between density and body mass. Previous global analyses have disagreed with relationships between density and body mass in individual communities partly because of this nonlinearity. Analyses of 45 mammalian communities show positive, negative, or even no relationship between density and body mass, depending on the trophic groups and body sizes of community members and the range of sizes. Population energy use is inequitably partitioned among populations, with populations of large mammals using more than 100 times more energy than the smallest mammals. Herbivorous mammals can use 25 times the energy used by carnivores, and populations of small insectivores use only 10% of the energy used by other carnivores of equivalent body mass},

  Comment                  = {ISI DATA WT784 Ong JE, Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Marine & Coastal Sci, George Town 11800, MALAYSIA English Article Determining the net exchange of constituents between a mangrove estuary system and the adjacent ocean has been re- examined using an extensive dataset from the Sungai Merbok a short, tidally energetic estuary in Malaysia. Previous analysis of the data had indicated that the time-mean sectionally averaged flow was not consistent with mass balance, apparently preventing meaningful estimation of net nutrient fluxes from the mangrove system. In this case the problem was aggravated by the lack of river gauge data and uncertainties introduced by the use of deflected-vane current meters to make the flow measurements. In an alternative approach to the analysis, we have sought to put bounds on the net discharge and hence obtain limits for the nutrient output from the estuary. Tide gauge measurements have been used in conjunction with the section flow data to determine the hypsometry of the mangrove system and hence yield an unbiased estimate of tidal transport Q(t). A salt balance condition, appropriate to a mixed estuary is then applied to permit an estimate of Q(f), the freshwater discharge. Q(f) determined this way is found to be close to zero and certainly less than estimates for the period (mean similar to 7 m(3) s(-1)) based on rainfall records and catchment area. The implication is that the combined effects of evaporation and transpiration are removing a large proportion of the fresh water entering the mangrove system from the rivers. The very low net discharge indicates total nitrogen exchange is dominated by the covariance of Q(t) with the sectionally averaged concentration N-t. The considerable variation in this latter term combined with the large amplitude of Q(t) results in a high variability of the nitrate flux so that the estimate of the mean (0.5 g s(-1)) is subject to substantial sampling uncertainty (SE = 12 g s(- 1)). The application of the salt balance condition to flux studies in other estuarine systems is considered. Particular attention is drawn to the requirements of this approach to flux determination and especially the need for good timing control to allow the proper determination of the tidal diffusion flux of salt and other components},

  Abstract                 = {Identification of species in natural populations has recently received increased attention with a number of investigators proposing rigorous methods for species delimitation. Morphologically conservative species ( or species complexes) with deep phylogenetic histories ( and limited gene flow) are likely to pose particular problems when attempting to delimit species, yet this is crucial to comparative studies of the geography of speciation. We apply two methods of species delimitation to an ancient group of lizards ( genus Xantusia) that occur throughout southwestern North America. Mitochondrial cytochrome b and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene sequences were generated from samples taken throughout the geographic range of Xantusia. Maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and nested cladogram analyses were used to estimate relationships among haplotypes and to infer evolutionary processes. We found multiple well-supported independent lineages within Xantusia, for which there is considerable discordance with the currently recognized taxonomy. High levels of sequence divergence (21.3%) suggest that the pattern in Xantusia may predate the vicariant events usually hypothesized for the fauna of the Baja California peninsula, and the existence of deeply divergent clades (18.8% - 26.9%) elsewhere in the complex indicates the occurrence of ancient sundering events whose genetic signatures were not erased by the late Wisconsin vegetation changes. We present a revised taxonomic arrangement for this genus consistent with the distinct mtDNA lineages and discuss the phylogeographic history of this genus as a model system for studies of speciation in North American deserts},

The crustaceans comprised the family Sphaeromatidae with three species and the family Limnoriidae with one species. Seven of the fourteen known genera of the teredinids were recorded. The bivalve wood borers were widely distributed in the local mangroves. Martesia striata was the most abundant wood borer at the Degaussing Range jetty, Lumut. Lyrodus pedicellatus was the most abundant shipworm in wooden panels. Shipworms were abundant on the subtidal panels where the genus Bankia, was most common while M. striata was abundant on the intertidal panels.

All six mangrove forests showed some damage but the amount varied considerably among and within each forest. Significant correlations between the levels of damage and abundance of different taxa, and changes in the structure of the molluscan assemblage along gradients of damage, suggest that indices based on measures of damage have the potential to provide a means for the rapid, wide scale evaluation of mangroves affected by impacts associated with human activities in urban areas},

  Abstract                 = {The abundance and species richness of mollusc and crab assemblages were examined in a subtropical mangrove forest in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, which has been disturbed and damaged by the construction of a wooden boardwalk and a path. Sections of the forest immediately adjacent to the boardwalk and path were compared with reference areas to determine whether changes to the small- scale structural complexity within the forest affected the benthic fauna. The disturbed area was characterised by having 65-80% fewer pneumatophores, significantly fewer species and individuals of molluscs, but significantly more species and individuals of crabs than the reference areas. The abundance of mangrove pneumatophores and the attached epiphytic algae were manipulated at two sites to determine whether observed differences in these features could account for the differences in the assemblage of molluscs in the disturbed area of the forest compared with reference areas. Five experimental treatments were used: undisturbed controls, pneumatophore removals (abundance reduced by ca. 65%), epiphytic algal removals (algae removed from ca. 65% of pneumatophores), pneumatophore disturbance controls and algal disturbance controls. The experimental reduction of the abundance of mangrove pneumatophores and the associated epiphytic algae led to significant declines (by as much as 83%) in the number of molluscs utilising the substratum in the modified plots. There was no significant difference in the abundance of molluscs in the pneumatophore and algal removal plots suggesting any effect was primarily related to removal of the epiphytic algae from the surface of the pneumatophores. The responses by the biota to the changes in the physical environment demonstrate that even relatively small-scale modifications to the physical structure of subtropical mangrove forests can lead to significant effects on the diversity and abundance of macrobenthic organisms in these habitats. Such modifications have the potential to cause cascading effects at higher trophic levels with a deterioration in the value of these habitats as nursery and feeding grounds. Future efforts at conservation of these estuarine environments must focus on the prevention or reduction of modifications to the physical structure and integrity of the system, rather than just on the prevention of loss of entire patches of habitat.

Based on previous experimental work, we constructed a path diagram reflecting presumed relationships between kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) and two other small rodent species. The technique was applied to examine the direct effects of competition and indirect effects mediated through vegetation. Path analysis gave varying and sometimes uninterpretable results when applied to data collected from unmanipulated and manipulated systems. The variation most likely can be attributed to some combination of inadequate specification of the path diagram, differences between unmanipulated and manipulated systems, varying responses to experiments of different duration, and natural temporal variation. Because these issues are applicable to many kinds of complex systems, we suggest caution before applying and when interpreting the results of path analysis},

  Abstract                 = {Key innovations may increase the number of taxa in a clade that possesses the proposed innovation in comparison to its sister group that lacks the trait through either increased speciation or reduced extinction rates. Comparing sister clades across several independent lineages provides statistical support that the trait has increased species diversity. Previous studies have indicated that there may not be a relationship between biotic dispersal and higher species diversity, but only a few of these studies specified habit, habitat, or type of disperser. No previous study has specified all of the above parameters and used a phylogenetic approach. This article examines species diversity in numerous lineages of tropical understory plants with small, fleshy, bird-dispersed fruits for which a reliable estimate of phylogenetic relationships is available. Clades with fleshy fruits are significantly more diverse than sister clades with dry fruits},

  Comment                  = {AB- New England's coastal plain ponds occupy areas of glacially deposited outwash, till, or former glacial lake beds. Generally, these ponds lie in gently sloping basins with no inlet or outlet and are intimately linked with the underlying groundwater or aquifer. Water levels rise and fall naturally with the seasons, depending on rainfall/evaporation cycles. There are hundreds of ponds, distributed in three main areas. New England's coastal plain ponds vary significantly in physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, but are united by several dominant features. (1) With rare exceptions they are permanent bodies of water and do not dry out annually as do southern US ponds. (2) They are highly acidic and nutrient-poor. (3) Their basins are sloping, creating concentric bands of vegetation as waters recede. (4) The dominant emergent, when present, is Juncus militaris, not Panicum hemitomon as in southern US ponds. (5) Dominant plants in the drawdown zone are graminoid and herbaceous species; woody plants are absent. Forty-one Atlantic coastal plain pond plant taxa are considered rare in one or more New England states, the great majority occurring only in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. One taxon is endemic to the region: Eupatorium leucolepis var. novae-angliae; five others are nearly so. Because they hold water during the summer, New England's coastal plain ponds are attractive to recreation and housing development. During 1970-1990 large-scale impacts resulted from these activities and from recreational vehicle use and water extraction, so that few pristine ponds are left},

  Abstract                 = {I studied the effect of treehole (microhabitat) size distribution in local habitats on geographic difference in aquatic metazoan community structure by comparing differences between two sites on Iriomote Island, and between Iriomote Island (subtropical) and Tsushima Island (temperate), in southwestern Japan. In treeholes at each local site, the amount of litter, the species richness and total biomass of metazoa were positively correlated with treehole capacity. Between the two sites on Iriomote Island (Shirahama and Komi), the amount of litter, biomass and species number per treehole was greater at Komi where the mean and variance of treehole size were greater, while the dependencies of these parameters on treehole capacity were common to both sites. Total species number was larger at Komi (2 predators and 20 saprophages) than at Shirahama (1 predator and 19 saprophages). Most of the dominant taxa colonized larger treeholes with higher probabilities, although one taxa showed the opposite trend. Treeholes on Tsushima were smaller than those on Iriomote. The metazoan fauna in treeholes consisted of 15 saprophages on Tsushima, being less richer than that on Iriomote Island which had 2 predators and 21 saprophages. However, the dependencies of litter amount and biomass on treehole capacity did not differ significantly between the islands, although treeholes on Iriomote harbored a greater number of species per treehole than those on Tsushima. This study indicated that there are general correlates between community structure within individual treeholes (infracommunity structure) and treehole capacity (microhabitat size). Therefore, microhabitat-size distribution is potentially a significant constraint of local community structure, and its variation may contribute to the variation in local and regional species richness},

The amount of leaf detritus increased with an increase in the capacity (volume) of the phytotelma. The input rate of leaves depended upon the opening area of the phytotelma. Twenty-one metazoan inhabitant taxa consisted of 17 dipteran saprophages, a helodid beetle larva, a nematoda, a naidid, and a predator, Toxorhynchites towadensis mosquito larva. Treeholes harbored 17 taxa and bamboo stumps 20; 16 taxa were common in both phytotelmata. The number of taxa and the biomass of metazoa per phytotelma was positively correlated with the capacity. The densities of dominant saprophages such as helodid, chironomid, and Culicoides larvae were positively correlated with the capacity of phytotelmata, and the variation in their abundance contributed much to the variation in the species composition in individual phytotelmata. With an increase in capacity, treeholes harbored more helodids and Culicoides, whereas bamboo stumps harbored more chironomids and Dasyhelea. Thus, the amount of resource, species richness and biomass per phytotelma largely depended upon the capacity, and the difference in community structure between treeholes and bamboo stumps was attributable to the differential colonization patterns of different taxa}

  Title                    = {Growth of two peat-forming nd the effect of the tube-dwelling e area of greatest atrazine use in North America. This analysis revealed that atrazine concentrations rarely exceed 20 mu g/L in rivers and streams that were the main focus of the aquatic ecological risk assessment. Following storm runoff, biota in lower-order streams may be exposed to pulses of atrazine greater than 20 mu g/L, but these exposures are short-lived. The assessment also considered exposures in lakes and reservoirs. The principal data set was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, which monitored residues in 76 Midwestern reservoirs in 11 states in 1992-1993. Residue concentrations in some reservoirs were similar to those in streams but persisted longer. Atrazine residues were widespread in reservoirs (92% occurrence), and the 90th percentile of this exposure distribution for early June to July was about 5 mu g/L. Mathematical simulation models of chemical fate were used to generalize the exposure analysis to other sites and to assess the potential effects of reduction in the application rates. Models were evaluated, modified, and calibrated against available monitoring data to validate that these models could predict atrazine runoff. PRZM-2 overpredicted atrazine concentrations by about an order of magnitude, whereas GLEAMS underpredicted by a factor of 2 to 5. Thus, exposure models were not used to extrapolate to other regions of atrazine use in this assessment. The effects assessment considered both freshwater and saltwater toxicity test results. Phytoplankton were the most sensitive organisms, followed, in decreasing order of sensitivity, by macrophytes, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, and fish. Atrazine inhibits photophosphorylation but typically does not result in lethality or permanent cell damage in the short term. This characteristic of atrazine required a different model than typically used for understanding the potential impact in aquatic systems, where lethality or nonreversible effects are usually assumed. In addition, recovery of phytoplankton from exposure to 5 to 20 mu g/L atrazine was demonstrated. In some mesocosm field experiments, phytoplankton and macrophytes were reduced after atrazine exposures greater than 20 mu g/L. However, populations were quickly reestablished, even while atrazine residues persisted in the water. Effects in field studies were judged to be ecologically important only at exposures of 50 mu g/L or greater. Mesocosm experiments did not reveal disruption of either ecosystem structure or function at atrazine concentrations typically encountered in the environment (generally 5 mu g/L or less). Based on an integration of laboratory bioassay data, field effects studies, and environmental monitoring data from watersheds in high-use areas in the Midwestern United States, the Panel concluded that atrazine does not pose a significant risk to the aquatic environment. Although some inhibitory effects on algae, phytoplankton, or macrophyte production may occur in small streams vulnerable to agricultural runoff, these effects are likel}of controversial systematic allocation, although their close relationship with es belonging to these genera, as well as to closely related Indo-Pacific genus d Curacao in the southern Caribbean.

  Abstract                 = {Plant characteristics that determine food quantity and quality to consumers exhibit extensive within-plant heterogeneity, and this heterogeneity is an important influence on the. interactions between plants and consumers (herbivores, pathogens, mutualists, soil-dwelling microorganisms). Here we present a functional model - based on plant vascular architecture and local environmental variability - that can be used to predict the patterns of within-plant resource heterogeneity. We argue that heterogeneity is generated largely by sectoriality, the restricted movement of resources along vascular traces within a plant. In essence, the combination of sectoriality and spatial variation in previous damage, nutrient, water, and fight availability generates predictable patterns of within-plant heterogeneity in tissue quality. We point out that vascular architecture differs across taxa, growth habit and plant developmental stage, and suggest that certain attributes of the environment maximize the extent of heterogeneity},
